We review the main ecological services across a variety of ECEs, including marshes, mangroves, nearshore coral reefs, seagrass beds, and sand beaches and dunes. Where possible, we indicate estimates of the key economic values arising from these services, and discuss how the natural variability of ECEs impacts their beneﬁts, the synergistic relationships of ECEs across seascapes, and management implications. Although reliable valuation estimates are beginning to emerge for the key services of some ECEs, such as coral reefs, salt marshes, and mangroves, many of the important beneﬁts of seagrass beds and sand dunes and beaches have not been assessed properly. Even for coral reefs, marshes, and mangroves, important ecological services have yet to be valued reliably, such as cross-ecosystem nutrient transfer (coral reefs), erosion control (marshes), and pollution control (mangroves). An important issue for valuing certain ECE services, such as coastal protection and habitat–ﬁshery linkages, is that the ecological functions underlying these services vary spatially and temporally. Allowing for the connectivity between ECE habitats also may have important implications for assessing the ecological functions underlying key ecosystems services, such coastal protection, control of erosion, and habitat–ﬁshery linkages. Finally, we conclude by suggesting an action plan for protecting and/or enhancing the immediate and longer-term values of ECE services. Because the connectivity of ECEs across land–sea gradients also inﬂuences the provision of certain ecosystem services, management of the entire seascape will be necessary to preserve such synergistic effects. Other key elements of an action plan include further ecological and economic collaborative research on valuing ECE services, improving institutional and legal frameworks for management, controlling and regulating destructive economic activities, and developing ecological restoration options.","2011-05","2025-09-07 18:12:18","2025-09-07 18:12:18","2025-09-07 18:12:18","169-193","","2","81","","Ecological Monographs","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/VDD8CLIG/Barbier et al. - 2011 - The value of estuarine and coastal ecosystem services.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet we still have a limited understanding of how temperature-dependence in physiology drives temperature-dependence in species-interactions. For predator-prey interactions, theory predicts that increases in temperature drive increases in metabolism and that animals respond to this increased energy expenditure by ramping up their food consumption to meet their metabolic demand. However, if consumption does not increase as rapidly with temperature as metabolism, increases in temperature can ultimately cause a reduction in consumer fitness and biomass via starvation.                                         Methods               Here we test the hypothesis that increases in temperature cause more rapid increases in metabolism than increases in consumption using the California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) as a model system. We acclimated individual lobsters to temperatures they experience sacross their biogeographic range (11, 16, 21, or 26°C), then measured whether lobster consumption rates are able to meet the increased metabolic demands of rising temperatures.                                         Results and discussion               We show positive effects of temperature on metabolism and predation, but in contrast to our hypothesis, rising temperature caused lobster consumption rates to increase at a faster rate than increases in metabolic demand, suggesting that for the mid-range of temperatures, lobsters are capable of ramping up consumption rates to increase their caloric demand. However, at the extreme ends of the simulated temperatures, lobster biology broke down. At the coldest temperature, lobsters had almost no metabolic activity and at the highest temperature, 33% of lobsters died. Our results suggest that temperature plays a key role in driving the geographic range of spiny lobsters and that spatial and temporal shifts in temperature can play a critical role in driving the strength of species interactions for a key predator in temperate reef ecosystems.","2023-02-07","2025-09-07 18:12:26","2025-09-07 18:12:26","2025-09-07 18:12:26","1072807","","","10","","Front.

Using photogrammetry, we measured patterns in changes in coral volume that were otherwise obscured by high variation from manual measurements.

Here, we investigated the extent to which foundation species may mediate the impacts of disturbance on ecological communities, using the kelp forest ecosystem as a study system. Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) grows rapidly and experiences wave disturbance from winter storms. We developed and analyzed a model of the effects of variable storm regimes on giant kelp population dynamics and of the cascading effects on kelp-mediated competition between benthic community members in kelp forests. Simulations of severe storm regimes resulted in a greater abundance of understory macroalgae and a lower abundance of sessile invertebrates than did milder regimes. Both the cascading effects of periodic loss of giant kelp as well as the degree to which storms directly impacted the benthos (in the form of scouring) influenced the outcome of competition between benthic community members. The model’s qualitative predictions were consistent with empirical data from a 20-yr time series of community dynamics, suggesting that interannual variability in disturbance that affects giant kelp abundance can have strong consequences for benthic community structure. Our findings point to the value of long-term studies in elucidating the interacting effects of disturbance and foundation species.","2021-05","2025-09-07 18:12:28","2025-09-07 18:12:28","2025-09-07 18:12:28","e03304","","5","102","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/2SB4HI6P/Detmer et al. - 2021 - Variation in disturbance to a foundation species structures the dynamics of a benthic reef community.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As coral reefs around the world are increasingly threatened by mass bleaching events, it is important to understand how these biotic interactions inﬂuence corals’ susceptibility to bleaching. We used dynamic energy budget modeling to explore how nitrogen excreted by coral-dwelling ﬁsh affects the physiological performance of host corals. In our model, ﬁsh presence inﬂuenced the functioning of the coralSymbiodiniaceae symbiosis by altering nitrogen availability, and the magnitude and sign of these effects depended on environmental conditions. Although our model predicted that ﬁsh-derived nitrogen can promote coral growth, the relationship between ﬁsh presence and coral tolerance of photo-oxidative stress was non-linear. Fish excretions supported denser symbiont populations that provided protection from incident light through self-shading. However, these symbionts also used more of their photosynthetic products for their own growth, rather than sharing with the coral host, putting the coral holobiont at a higher risk of becoming carbon-limited and bleaching. The balance between the beneﬁts of increased symbiont shading and costs of reduced carbon sharing depended on environmental conditions. Thus, while there were some scenarios under which ﬁsh presence increased corals’ tolerance of light stress, ﬁsh could also exacerbate bleaching and slow or prevent subsequent recovery. We discuss how the contrast between the potentially harmful effects of ﬁsh predicted by our model and results of empirical studies may relate to key model assumptions that warrant further investigation. Overall, this study provides a foundation for future work on how coral-associated fauna inﬂuence the bioenergetics of their host corals, which in turn has implications for how these corals respond to bleaching-inducing stressors.","2022-05","2025-09-07 18:12:30","2025-09-07 18:12:30","2025-09-07 18:12:30","111087","","","541","","Journal of Theoretical Biology","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/M578LVM5/Detmer et al. - 2022 - Fertilization by coral-dwelling fish promotes coral growth but can exacerbate bleaching response.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet across taxa, interaction strength is strongly related to predator size, prey size and prey density, suggesting that general cross‐taxonomic relationships could be used to predict how strongly individual species interact.

To address this question, we quantified the size and density dependence of the functional response of the California spiny lobster                     Panulirus interruptus                     , foraging on a key ecosystem engineer, the purple sea urchin                     Strongylocentrotus purpuratus                     , in experimental mesocosms. Based on these results, we then estimated variation in lobster–urchin interaction strength across five sites and 9 years of observational data. Finally, we compared our experimental estimates to predictions based on general size‐scaling relationships from the literature.                                                                        Our results reveal that predator and prey body size has the greatest effect on interaction strength when prey abundance is high. Due to consistently high urchin densities in the field, our simulations suggest that body size—relative to density—accounted for up to 87% of the spatio‐temporal variation in interaction strength. However, general size‐scaling relationships failed to predict the magnitude of interactions between lobster and urchin; even the best prediction from the literature was, on average, an order of magnitude (+18.7×) different than our experimental predictions.                                                     Harvest and climate change are driving reductions in the average body size of many marine species. Anticipating how reductions in body size will alter species interactions is critical to managing marine systems in an ecosystem context. Our results highlight the extent to which differences in size‐frequency distributions can drive dramatic variation in the strength of interactions across narrow spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, our work suggests that species‐specific estimates for the scaling of interaction strength with body size, rather than general size‐scaling relationships, are necessary to quantitatively predict how reductions in body size will alter interaction strengths.","2023-05","2025-09-07 18:12:31","2025-09-07 18:12:32","2025-09-07 18:12:31","1075-1088","","5","92","","Journal of Animal Ecology","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/F4IGLF4P/DiFiore and Stier - 2023 - Variation in body size drives spatial and temporal variation in lobster–urchin interaction strength.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Grazing halos — barren areas of sand surrounding coral reefs — are readily visible in remotely sensed imagery, and are formed by herbivores preferentially grazing close to the safety of the reef. Grazing halo size can vary by more than an order of magnitude, yet we lack an understanding of what underlies this variation. Changes in grazing intensity and the distance herbivores travel may be influenced by predation risk, resource availability, and structural attributes of the reef. Here, we tested how predator density, herbivore density, and patch reef area are correlated with halo size and grazing patterns by linking satellite imagery with mensurative experiments on patch reefs in the Caribbean. Chronic predation risk suppressed the overall foraging intensity of herbivorous fishes; a doubling in predator density led to a 29% decrease in grazing. Variation in herbivore density, which was tightly correlated with patch reef area, was linked to the distance herbivores foraged from the reef. Furthermore, herbivore density and/or reef area was the best predictor of halo width at field sites, and reef area explained a significant proportion of the variation in halo size across the landscape. Our results contribute to a growing body of research suggesting that halos may function as footprints of ecological processes, such as herbivory, that can be quantified using remote sensing, and offer a potential avenue to improve monitoring of coral reef management.","2019-09-26","2025-09-07 18:12:33","2025-09-07 18:12:33","2025-09-07 18:12:33","71-81","","","627","","Mar.

Using laboratory studies, this study quantiﬁed (1) the functional response of nudibranchs, (2) the effect of sea hare size on predation rates, and (3) the strength of the indirect effect of sea hare predation on cyanobacteria (i.e., a trophic cascade). Nudibranchs consumed on average 2.4 sea hares d-1, with the consumption of small sea hares 22 times greater than the consumption of large sea hares. Predation of sea hares reduced herbivory. Cyanobacterial biomass was 1.5 times greater when nudibranchs were present relative to when nudibranchs were absent. Although sea hare grazing can substantially reduce cyanobacterial biomass, predation of sea hares may mitigate grazing pressure, and therefore increase the abundance of cyanobacteria.","2010-06","2025-09-07 18:12:37","2025-09-07 18:12:37","2025-09-07 18:12:37","393-397","","2","29","","Coral Reefs","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/MUA9I5BF/Geange and Stier - 2010 - Charismatic microfauna alter cyanobacterial production through a trophic cascade.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When an individual’s persistence in a community depends upon the strength of competitive interactions, changes in the timing of arrival relative to the arrival of a competitor can modify competitive strength and, ultimately, establishment in the community. We investigated whether the strength of intracohort competitive interactions between recent settlers of the reef ﬁshes Thalassoma hardwicke and T. quinquevittatum are dependent on the sequence and temporal separation of their arrival into communities. To achieve this, we manipulated the sequence and timing of arrival of each species onto experimental patch reefs by simulating settlement pulses and monitoring survival and aggressive interactions. Both species survived best in the absence of competitors, but when competitors were present, they did best when they arrived at the same time. Survival declined as each species entered the community progressively later than its competitor and as aggression by its competitor increased. Intraspeciﬁc effects of resident T. hardwicke were similar to interspeciﬁc effects. This study shows that the strength of competition depends not only on the identity of competitors, but also on the sequence and timing of their interactions, suggesting that when examining interaction strengths, it is important to identify temporal variability in the direction and magnitude of their effects. Furthermore, our ﬁndings provide empirical evidence for the importance of competitive lotteries in the maintenance of species diversity in demographically open marine systems.","2009-10","2025-09-07 18:12:38","2025-09-07 18:12:38","2025-09-07 18:12:38","2868-2878","","10","90","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/WBMK9BYD/Geange and Stier - 2009 - Order of arrival affects competition in two reef fishes.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When asymmetric competition involves 2 or more component species, the ranking of species’ competitive abilities may form competitive hierarchies (all species of higher rank out-compete all species of lower rank) or competitive networks (at least 1 species of lower rank out-competes ≥1 species of higher rank). Expectations of resource monopolization and patterns of distribution and abundance among species in competitive networks are expected to differ from those in competitive hierarchies. We conducted a field experiment to evaluate the relative competitive abilities of juveniles of 3 closely related species of reef fish (bird wrasse Gomphosus varius, fivestripe wrasse Thalassoma quinquevittatum and the sixbar wrasse T. hardwicke) on Moorea, French Polynesia. We controlled for intrinsic variation in survivorship among species and found that competition among these 3 species was highly asymmetric, resulting in a simple competitive hierarchy (sequence of competitive ability from superior to inferior competitors): fivestripe wrasse > bird wrasse > sixbar wrasse. We surveyed densities of the 3 reef fish species on 55 patch reefs and observed significant negative spatial covariation between superior and inferior competitors, consistent with competitive hierarchies that limit the spatial distributions of the inferior species (sixbar wrasse). Our work demonstrates that intense asymmetric competition and the formation of competitive hierarchies may be an important determinant of resource monopolization and patterns of distribution and abundance in reef fishes.","2013-01-09","2025-09-07 18:12:41","2025-09-07 18:12:41","2025-09-07 18:12:41","239-248","","","472","","Mar.

Here, we combine field surveys and a laboratory feeding experiment in coral reef fish communities to show that small and large predators of the same species can have similar effects. Specifically, surveys show that the presence of a small predator (               Paracirrhites arcatus               ) was correlated with lower chances of prey fish presence, but these correlations were independent of predator size. Experimental trials corroborated the size-independent effect of the predator; attack rates were indistinguishable between small and large predators, suggesting relatively even effects of hawkfish in various size classes on the same type of prey.

These demands have similarly increased the pressure we place on these systems, and we now cause considerable damage globally. If we want to maintain healthy ocean ecosystems into the future, we must learn to use ocean resources in a sustainable way and facilitate recovery in regions that have declined. Determining how to make these goals a reality, however, is no small challenge. Ingeman               et al.               review the challenge presented by attempting both to recover and to use ecosystems simultaneously and discuss several approaches for facilitating this essential dual goal.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaav1004                        ,                             BACKGROUND               Ocean defaunation and loss of marine ecosystem services present an urgent need to recover degraded ocean ecosystems. Growing scientific awareness, strong regulations, and effective management have begun to fulfill the promise of recovery. Unfortunately, many efforts remain unsuccessful, in part because marine ecosystems and human societies are changing. Rapid shifts in environmental conditions are undermining previously effective recovery strategies. Moreover, divergent perceptions of recovery exist. Efforts toward reversing marine degradation must address the dynamic social-ecological landscape in which recoveries occur, or forever chase a moving target.                                         ADVANCES                                Recovery efforts of tomorrow will require institutional and tactical flexibility to keep pace with a changing ocean, and an inclusive concept of recovery. Further, vital population-level efforts will be most successful when complemented by a broader ecosystem and social-ecological perspective. In this Review, we provide a synthesis of ocean-recovery goals as moving targets and highlight promising steps forward. (i) Society can reenvision a more inclusive definition of recovery by recognizing a multiplicity of recovery goals.                                  While acknowledging the priority of basic conservation imperatives, successful recoveries can encompass a range of outcomes in the space between minimum ecological viability and maximum carrying capacity. (ii) Research can help anticipate future recovery dynamics and identify pathways toward resilient ecosystems.                                  Ongoing advances are improving our ability to predict the effects of environmental change on ocean productivity and to calibrate recovery targets to changing conditions. As a complement to predict-and-prescribe methods, research can also point the way toward robust approaches in the face of irreducible uncertainty. (iii) Policy-makers can embrace nimble approaches to keep pace with change and integrate governance to operate seamlessly from local to regional scales. Future recovery frameworks should enable rapid response to changing conditions and allow fluid coordination among institutions. Such policies will mitigate conflicts between recovery objectives at different spatial scales and better integrate local knowledge and traditional cultural practices around recovery.                                                        OUTLOOK               Application of these principles will help to reshape recovery of marine ecosystems, yet important scientific questions and societal barriers remain. For researchers, interactions among multiple components of environmental change will test the limits of prediction in tomorrow’s ocean. For managers and policy-makers, operationalizing an inclusive definition of recovery organized around social-ecological resilience will prove more challenging than simply recrafting recovery policies with new recovery metrics. Rather, this process will involve designing policies that align incentives for disparate human actors toward coherent recovery goals. Looking ahead, emerging technologies can enable interventions necessary to match the scale of the challenge. It remains possible to recover lost biodiversity in the ocean and to enhance the delivery of marine ecosystem services. Doing so will require a strategic, nuanced, and flexible conceptualization of ocean recoveries that can keep pace with ever-changing physical, ecological, and social environments.                                                   Environmental shifts create moving targets for marine recoveries.                                        (                     A                     to                     D                     ) Since the end of whaling (1), North Atlantic right whales have experienced steady recovery, fueled by abundant copepod prey (2) and aided by vessel speed restrictions and routing human activities away from sensitive habitats (3). Rapid warming has caused reproductive failure by reducing the availability of copepods (4). In 2017, whales followed prey into areas where effective vessel avoidance measures were not in place, substantially increasing mortality from collisions and entanglement (5). Extending vessel restrictions may be effective in reducing mortality. Looking ahead, “rope-less” fishing gear (6) and real-time data sharing (7) offer hope for resuming recovery. Reduced productivity and increased mortality may necessitate recalibrating recovery timelines (8) compared to original projections (9).

Boersma, alexboersma.com                                       ,              Growing scientific awareness, strong regulations, and effective management have begun to fulfill the promise of recovery in the ocean. However, many efforts toward ocean recovery remain unsuccessful, in part because marine ecosystems and the human societies that depend upon them are constantly changing. Furthermore, recovery efforts are embedded in marine social-ecological systems where large-scale dynamics can inhibit recovery. We argue that the ways forward are to (i) rethink an inclusive definition of recovery that embraces a diversity of stakeholder perspectives about acceptable recovery goals and ecosystem outcomes; (ii) encourage research that enables anticipation of feasible recovery states and identifies pathways toward resilient ecosystems; and (iii) adopt policies that are sufficiently nimble to keep pace with rapid change and governance that works seamlessly from local to regional scales. Application of these principles can facilitate successful recoveries in a world where environmental conditions and social imperatives are constantly shifting.","2019-01-25","2025-09-07 18:12:49","2025-09-07 18:12:49","2025-09-07 18:12:49","eaav1004","","6425","363","","Science","Ocean recoveries for tomorrow’s Earth","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/6QKL9N52/Ingeman et al. - 2019 - Ocean recoveries for tomorrow’s Earth Hitting a moving target.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large carnivores represent critical conservation targets that have experienced historical declines as a result of direct exploitation and habitat loss. We examine taxonomic and geographic variation in current extinction risk and recovery indices, identify conservation actions associated with positive outcomes, and reveal anthropogenic threats linked to ongoing declines. We find that fewer than 10% of global large carnivore populations are increasing, and only 12 species (3.3%) have experienced genuine improvement in extinction risk, mostly limited to recoveries among marine mammals. Recovery is associated with species legislation enacted at national and international levels, and with management of direct exploitation.

Many ecosystems are subject to different types of disturbance that either remove biogenic structures or leave them intact. Here we used a mathematical model to quantify how the resilience of coral reef ecosystems may be differentially affected following structure-removing and structure-retaining disturbance events, focusing in particular on the potential for regime shifts from coral to macroalgae. We found that dead coral skeletons could substantially diminish coral resilience if they provided macroalgae refuge from herbivory, a key feedback associated with the recovery of coral populations. Our model shows that the material legacy of dead skeletons broadens the range of herbivore biomass over which coral and macroalgae states are bistable. Hence, material legacies can alter resilience by modifying the underlying relationship between a system driver (herbivory) and a state variable (coral cover).","2023-04","2025-09-07 18:12:54","2025-09-07 18:12:54","2025-09-07 18:12:54","e4006","","4","104","","Ecology","Material legacies can degrade resilience","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/VRXB757T/Kopecky et al. - 2023 - Material legacies can degrade resilience Structure‐retaining disturbances promote regime shifts on.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite their critical importance, the role of foundation species in stabilizing natural communities has seldom been quantified. In theory, the stability of a foundation species should promote community stability by enhancing species richness, altering the population fluctuations of individual species, or both. Here we tested the hypothesis that the stability of a marine foundation species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, increased the stability of the aggregate biomass of a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of understory algae and sessile invertebrates that compete for space beneath the giant kelp canopy. To achieve this goal, we analyzed an 18-yr time series of the biomass of giant kelp and its associated benthic community collected from 32 plots distributed among nine shallow reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, USA. We showed that the stability of understory algae and sessile invertebrates was positively and indirectly related to the stability of giant kelp, which primarily resulted from giant kelp’s direct positive association with species richness. The stability of all community types was positively related to species richness via increased species stability and species asynchrony. The stabilizing effects of richness were three to four times stronger when algae and invertebrates were considered separately rather than in combination. Our finding that diversity–stability relationships were stronger in communities consisting of species with similar resource requirements suggests that competition for shared resources rather than differential responses to environmental conditions played a more important role in stabilizing the community. Increasing threats to structure-forming foundation species worldwide necessitates a detailed understanding of how they influence their associated community. This study is among the first to show that dampened temporal fluctuations in the biomass of a foundation species is an important determinant of the stability of the complex communities it supports.","2020-05","2025-09-07 18:12:56","2025-09-07 18:12:56","2025-09-07 18:12:56","e02987","","5","101","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/MUG58NZS/Lamy et al. - 2020 - Foundation species promote community stability by increasing diversity in a giant kelp forest.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Theoretical predictions do not always match empirical evidence from individual reserves, so carefully designed studies are essential for accurately assessing spillover and its contribution to fisheries. Biomass buildup within reserves, and spillover from reserve borders, also usually takes time to develop. In 2003, a network of no-take marine reserves was established in the Northern Channel Islands (NCI) of southern California (CA) to conserve biodiversity and to eventually enhance local fisheries through spillover of larvae, juveniles, and adults. The reserve network impacted the local CA spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) fishery by removing about 20% of fishing grounds in the NCI. In 2008, a collaborative fisheries research effort detected substantial lobster population increases within reserves, and an indication of the possible spillover of adult lobsters across reserve borders. To estimate whether and how much populations within reserves, and spillover from reserves, have increased through time, we repeated the sampling program 10 years later in 2018 at two of the three original reserves. Scientific trapping was conducted prior to the fishing season along a spatial gradient beginning deep within the reserves to reference sites located outside (≥2 km) of reserve borders. Results showed that legal-sized lobster abundance in traps (catch per unit effort) increased by 125%–465% deep inside reserves, and by 223%–331% at sites near to reserve borders, and by nearly 400% just outside of reserve borders over the 10-year period, thus indicating a substantial increase in spillover across reserve borders. A similar pattern was observed in lobster biomass caught in traps at the two reserves. This study demonstrates how spillover scales with biomass buildup and that collaborative fisheries research can be used to assess the efficacy of marine reserves as fishery management tools worldwide.","2022-06","2025-09-07 18:12:57","2025-09-07 18:12:57","2025-09-07 18:12:57","e4110","","6","13","","Ecosphere","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/VCEMAYMJ/Lenihan et al. - 2022 - Increasing spillover enhances southern California spiny lobster catch along marine reserve borders.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a remedy to the Rashomon effect, policy-makers have turned to scientists as honest brokers who share a common environmental reality.

We highlight three types of conﬂicts created by a single-species focus: (1) recovering predator populations that increase competition with humans for the same prey, (2) new tradeoffs that emerge when protected predators consume protected prey, and (3) multiple predator populations that compete for the same limited prey. We use two food webs with parallel conservation challenges, the Northeast Paciﬁc Ocean and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, to demonstrate legal/policy conﬂicts and the policy levers that exist to ameliorate conﬂicts. In some cases, scientiﬁc uncertainty about the ecological interaction hinders progress towards resolving conﬂicts. In others, available policy options are insufﬁcient.

As a result, past studies overestimated the occurrence of risk enhancement for additive designs, and tended to overestimate the occurrence of risk reduction for substitutive designs.

Where predators have been considered, the common prediction is that predators reduce mutualist abundance and, as a consequence, decrease service provision. Here, we use a mathematical model of a predatory fish that consumes two competing coral mutualists to show that predators can also have indirect positive effects on hosts when they preferentially consume competitively dominant mutualists that are also lower in quality. In these cases, predation reverses the outcome of competition, allowing the higher quality mutualist to dominate and enhancing host performance. The direction and strength of predator effects depend on asymmetries in mutualist competition, service provision, and predation vulnerability. Our findings suggest that when the strength of predation shifts (e.g., due to exploitative harvest of top predators, introduction of new species, or range shifts in response to climate change), mutualist communities will exhibit dynamic responses with nonmonotonic effects on host service provision.","2023-01","2025-09-07 18:13:08","2025-09-07 18:13:08","2025-09-07 18:13:08","e4382","","1","14","","Ecosphere","Cascading benefits of mutualists' predators on foundation species","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/N8DVTDSW/Moeller et al. - 2023 - Cascading benefits of mutualists' predators on foundation species A model inspired by coral reef ec.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we utilize the ability of normally paedomorphic adult axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum) to undergo induced metamorphosis by thyroxine exposure to test how metamorphosis and body size affects regeneration in age-matched paedomorphic and metamorphic individuals. We show that body size does not affect regeneration in adult axolotls, but metamorphosis causes a twofold reduction in regeneration rate, and lead to carpal and digit malformations. Furthermore, we ﬁnd evidence that metamorphic blastemal cells may take longer to traverse the cell cycle and display a lower proliferative rate.

This is particularly true in the oceans where spatial scales of management are often mismatched with spatially complex metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences, and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in harvested metapopulations in three ways. First, we generate novel theory illustrating when and how harvesting metapopulations increases spatial variability and in turn masks local-scale volatility. Second, we illustrate why spatial variability in harvested metapopulations leads to negative consequences using an empirical example of a Pacific herring metapopulation. Finally, we construct a numerical management strategy evaluation model to identify and highlight potential solutions for mismatches in spatial scale and spatial variability. Our results highlight that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales, however, ignoring spatial complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences for people and animals that interact with resources at small scales. Harvesting metapopulations magnifies spatial variability, which creates discrepancies between regional and local trends while increasing risk of local population collapses. Such effects asymmetrically impact locally constrained fishers and predators, which are more exposed to risks of localized collapses. Importantly, we show that dynamically optimizing harvest can minimize local risk without sacrificing yield. Thus, multiple nested scales of management may be necessary to avoid cryptic collapses in metapopulations and the ensuing ecological, social, and economic consequences.","2020-04","2025-09-07 18:13:16","2025-09-07 18:13:16","2025-09-07 18:13:16","e02051","","3","30","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/VKFEB3PI/Okamoto et al. - 2020 - Spatial variation in exploited metapopulations obscures risk of collapse.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We simultaneously examined the effects of individual variation in prey activity level, covering behavior, and body size on prey survival with predators using an urchin–lobster system. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that slow‐moving purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and urchins who deploy extensive substrate (pebbles and stones) covering behavior will out‐survive active urchins that deploy little to no covering behavior when pitted against a predator, the California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus). We evaluated this hypothesis by first confirming whether individual urchins exhibit temporally consistent differences in activity level and covering behavior, which they did. Next, we placed groups of four urchins in mesocosms with single lobster and monitored urchin survival for 108 hr. High activity level was negatively associated with survival, whereas urchin size and covering behavior independently did not influence survival. The negative effect of urchin activity level on urchin survival was strong for smaller urchins and weaker for large urchins. Taken together, these results suggest that purple urchin activity level and size jointly determine their susceptibility to predation by lobsters. This is potentially of great interest, because predation by recovering lobster populations could alter the stability of kelp forests by culling specific phenotypes, like foraging phenotypes, from urchin populations.","2019-10","2025-09-07 18:13:21","2025-09-07 18:13:21","2025-09-07 18:13:21","716-723","","10","125","","Ethology","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/WWTQCCCK/Pretorius et al. - 2019 - Predator‐induced selection on urchin activity level depends on urchin body size.pdf","","","","Koenig, Walter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the phenomenon of herbivore-driven regime shifts is well documented, we only partially understand the mechanisms underlying these events. Here, we combine herbivory experiments with 21 years of long-term monitoring data of kelp forest ecosystems to test the hypothesis that herbivores drive regime shifts when herbivory exceeds primary production. To test this hypothesis, we quantified how the foraging habits of an important group of marine herbivores—sea urchins—change with increases in sea urchin biomass and trigger regime shifts to a foundation species, giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). Using experiments, we quantified how the grazing capacity of urchins increases as urchin biomass increases, then we combined these estimates of urchin grazing capacity with estimates of kelp production to predict when and where urchin grazing capacity exceeded kelp production. When grazing capacity exceeded kelp production, sea urchins caused a 50-fold reduction in giant kelp biomass. Our findings support the hypothesis that the balance between herbivory and production underlies herbivore-driven regime shifts in Southern California kelp forests and provides insight into when and where urchins are likely to force regime shifts in kelp forest ecosystems.","2022-05","2025-09-07 18:13:22","2025-09-07 18:13:22","2025-09-07 18:13:22","e3673","","5","103","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/4NV2DMFG/Rennick et al. - 2022 - Detrital supply suppresses deforestation to maintain healthy kelp forest ecosystems.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, these studies have centred around individual focal species and at single trophic levels, ignoring the role of phenotypic variation in multiple taxa within an ecosystem. Given the ubiquitous nature of local adaptation, and thus intraspecific variation, we sought to understand how combinations of intraspecific variation in multiple species within an ecosystem impacts its ecology. Using two species that co-occur and demonstrate adaptation to their natal environments, black cottonwood (               Populus trichocarpa               ) and three-spined stickleback (               Gasterosteus aculeatus               ), we investigated the effects of intraspecific phenotypic variation on both top-down and bottom-up forces using a large-scale aquatic mesocosm experiment. Black cottonwood genotypes exhibit genetic variation in their productivity and consequently their leaf litter subsidies to the aquatic system, which mediates the strength of top-down effects from stickleback on prey abundances. Abundances of four common invertebrate prey species and available phosphorous, the most critically limiting nutrient in freshwater systems, are dictated by the interaction between genetic variation in cottonwood productivity and stickleback morphology. These interactive effects fit with ecological theory on the relationship between productivity and top-down control and are comparable in strength to the effects of predator addition. Our results illustrate that intraspecific variation, which can evolve rapidly, is an under-appreciated driver of community structure and ecosystem function, demonstrating that a multi-trophic perspective is essential to understanding the role of evolution in structuring ecological patterns.","2015-08-07","2025-09-07 18:13:24","2025-09-07 18:13:24","2025-09-07 18:13:24","20151234","","1812","282","","Proc.

Unprecedented climatic variability is interacting with unmistakable long-term trends, all against a backdrop of intensifying human activities. What remains unclear, however, is how to evaluate whether conditions have changed sufﬁciently to provoke major responses of species, habitats, and communities. We developed a framework based on multimodel inference to deﬁne ecosystem-based thresholds for human and environmental pressures in the California Current marine ecosystem. To demonstrate how to apply the framework, we explored two decades of data using gradient forest and generalized additive model analyses, screening for nonlinearities and potential threshold responses of ecosystem states (n = 9) across environmental (n = 6) and human (n = 10) pressures. These analyses identiﬁed the existence of threshold responses of ﬁve ecosystem states to four environmental and two human pressures. Both methods agreed on threshold relationships in two cases: (1) the winter copepod anomaly and habitat modiﬁcation, and (2) sea lion pup production and the summer mode of the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Considered collectively, however, these alternative analytical approaches imply that as many as ﬁve of the nine ecosystem states may exhibit threshold changes in response to negative PDO values in the summer (copepods, scavengers, groundﬁsh, and marine mammals). This result is consistent with the idea that the inﬂuence of the PDO extends across multiple trophic levels, but extends current knowledge by deﬁning the nonlinear nature of these responses. This research provides a new way to interpret changes in the intensities of human and environmental pressures as they relate to the ecological integrity of the California Current ecosystem. These insights can be used to make more informed assessments of when and under what conditions intervention, preparation, and mitigation may enhance progress toward ecosystem-based management goals.","2017-06","2025-09-07 18:13:27","2025-09-07 18:13:27","2025-09-07 18:13:27","e01860","","6","8","","Ecosphere","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/H6IS7MD4/Samhouri et al. - 2017 - Defining ecosystem thresholds for human activities and environmental pressures in the California Cur.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As cities expand, the ability of coastal ecosystems to provide the benefits people derive from nature, ranging from food from fisheries to coastal defense to maritime transportation and beyond, is in question. While it is well understood that coastal development changes ecosystems, quantitative insights about how terrestrial urbanization fundamentally alters ecosystem structure and function in adjacent freshwater and downstream coastal marine habitats remain rare, though a general expectation is that impacts of terrestrial urbanization will attenuate from land to freshwater to coastal marine habitats. Empirical assessments of these phenomena are especially important for species that rely on freshwater and coastal marine habitats at multiple points in their life cycles, including endangered and threatened Pacific salmon (               Oncorhynchus               spp.). We investigated associations between landscape-scale urbanization and ecosystem structure (biodiversity of epibenthic invertebrate taxa) and function (benthic net primary productivity and decomposition) in freshwater and coastal marine habitats across six pairs of more and less urbanized, coastal watersheds in Puget Sound, WA, USA, using principal components analysis, analysis of covariance, and Mantel tests. Greater upland urbanization was associated with greater reductions in freshwater biodiversity, measured as the density and evenness of epibenthic invertebrate families. In contrast and surprisingly, however, coastal marine biodiversity (measured as the density and evenness of epibenthic invertebrate families) tended to be higher at more urbanized sites, suggesting the potential role of low to moderate levels of urbanization-related disturbance in determining coastal marine biodiversity patterns. We found no statistical association between urbanization and freshwater and coastal marine ecosystem functions, estimated from changes in accumulated algal biomass on tiles (benthic net primary productivity) and loss of biomass from litter bags (decomposition). In addition, there was no evidence that changes in ecosystem structure and function with urbanization were more severe in freshwater than coastal marine habitats, as might be expected if the land-sea boundary diminished effects of landscape-scale urbanization. Our results suggest that the effects of urbanization can be complex and that attention to terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal marine systems in concert will produce more effective, ecosystem-based management.","2022-09-16","2025-09-07 18:13:28","2025-09-07 18:13:28","2025-09-07 18:13:28","931319","","","9","","Front.

Appendage regeneration appears to be common when viewed across the metazoan phylogeny, yet this ability has been lost in many taxa to varying degrees. Within species, the capacity for regeneration also can vary ontogenetically among individuals. Here we argue that appendage regeneration along the secondary body axis may be constrained by fundamental traits such as body size, aging, life stage, and growth pattern. Studies of the molecular mechanisms affecting regeneration have been conducted primarily with small organisms at early life stages. Such investigations disregard the dramatic shifts in morphology and physiology that organisms undergo as they age, grow, and mature. To help explain interspeciﬁc and intraspeciﬁc constraints on regeneration, we link particular fundamental traits to speciﬁc molecular mechanisms that control regeneration. We present a new synthesis for how these fundamental traits may affect the molecular mechanisms of regeneration at the tissue, cellular, and genomic levels of biological organization. Future studies that explore regeneration in organisms across a broad phylogenetic scale, and within an ontogenetic framework, will help elucidate the proximate mechanisms that modulate regeneration and may reveal new biomedical applications for use in regenerative medicine.","2012-05","2025-09-07 18:13:33","2025-09-07 18:13:33","2025-09-07 18:13:33","330-345","","2","87","","Biological Reviews","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/7CWDC2AL/Seifert et al. - 2012 - The influence of fundamental traits on mechanisms controlling appendage regeneration.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence indicates that explicitly addressing tipping points leads to improved management outcomes. Drawing on theory and examples from marine systems, we distill a set of seven principles to guide effective management in ecosystems with tipping points, derived from the best available science. These principles are based on observations that tipping points (1) are possible everywhere, (2) are associated with intense and/or multifaceted human use, (3) may be preceded by changes in earlywarning indicators, (4) may redistribute benefits among stakeholders, (5) affect the relative costs of action and inaction, (6) suggest biologically informed management targets, and (7) often require an adaptive response to monitoring. We suggest that early action to preserve system resilience is likely more practical, affordable, and effective than late action to halt or reverse a tipping point. We articulate a conceptual approach to management focused on linking management targets to thresholds, tracking early-warning signals of ecosystem instability, and stepping up investment in monitoring and mitigation as the likelihood of dramatic ecosystem change increases. This approach can simplify and economize management by allowing decision makers to capitalize on the increasing value of precise information about threshold relationships when a system is closer to tipping or by ensuring that restoration effort is sufficient to tip a system into the desired regime.","2015-07","2025-09-07 18:13:34","2025-09-07 18:13:35","2025-09-07 18:13:34","1-18","","5","1","","Ecosyst Health Sustain","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/VMCTM6AN/Selkoe et al. - 2015 - Principles for managing marine ecosystems prone to tipping points.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Marine forage fishes, such as sardines, anchovies and herring, are a nexus for such trade-offs because they are both central nodes in marine food webs and targeted by fisheries. An important example is Pacific herring,               Clupea pallisii               in the Northeast Pacific. Herring populations are subject to two distinct fisheries: one that harvests adults and one that harvests spawned eggs. We develop stochastic, age-structured models to assess the interaction between fisheries, herring populations and the persistence of predators reliant on herring populations. We show that egg- and adult-fishing have asymmetric effects on herring population dynamics - herring stocks can withstand higher levels of egg harvest before becoming depleted. Second, ecosystem thresholds proposed to ensure the persistence of herring predators do not necessarily pose more stringent constraints on fisheries than conventional, fishery driven harvest guidelines. Our approach provides a general template to evaluate ecosystem trade-offs between stage-specific harvest practices in relation to environmental variability, the risk of fishery closures and the risk of exceeding ecosystem thresholds intended to ensure conservation goals are met.","2014-11-19","2025-09-07 18:13:38","2025-09-07 18:13:38","2025-09-07 18:13:38","7110","","1","4","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/HXRF5FN5/Shelton et al. - 2014 - Assessing trade-offs to inform ecosystem-based fisheries management of forage fish.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a ﬁeld experiment on coral reef ﬁshes in Moorea, French Polynesia, to quantify how differing levels of habitat availability (controlling for quality) increased and/or redirected colonizing larval ﬁsh. Focal reefs without neighboring reefs received two to four times more settlers than reefs with adjacent habitat, demonstrating that increased habitat redirected larval ﬁsh. At the scale of the entire reef array, total colonization increased 1.3-fold in response to a sixfold increase in reef area (and a 2.75-fold increase in adjusted habitat availability). Thus, propagules were both increased and redirected, a result midway between the Field-of-Dreams and Propagule Redirection Hypotheses. A recruitment model using our data and ﬁeld estimates of density-dependent recruitment predicts that habitat addition increases recruitment primarily by ameliorating the negative effects of competition at existing sites rather than increasing colonization at the new sites per se.

However, predator densities vary in time, and these effects may not be well represented by studies that use constant predator densities. Although studies have independently examined the importance of predator density, temporal variability, and timing of arrival (i.e., early or late relative to prey), the relative contribution of these different predator regimes on prey abundance, diversity, and composition remains poorly understood. The hawkﬁsh (Paracirrhites arcatus), a carnivorous coral reef ﬁsh, exhibits substantial variability in patch occupancy, density, and timing of arrival to natural reefs. Our ﬁeld experiments demonstrated that effects of hawkﬁsh on prey abundance depended on both hawkﬁsh density and the timing of their arrival, but not on variability in hawkﬁsh density. Relative to treatments without hawkﬁsh, hawkﬁsh presence reduced prey abundance by 50%. This effect increased with a doubling of hawkﬁsh density (an additional 33% reduction), and when hawkﬁsh arrived later during community development (a 34% reduction). Hawkﬁsh did not affect within-patch diversity (species richness), but they increased between-patch diversity (beta) based on species incidence (22%), and caused shifts in species composition.

These interactions operate between prey species as well: the benefits of group living decline in the presence of an alternative prey species. We apply a novel model‐fitting approach to data from field experiments to distinguish among competing hypotheses about shifts in predator foraging behavior across a range of predator and prey densities. Our study provides novel analytical tools for analyzing predator foraging behavior and offers insight into the processes driving the dynamics of coral reef fish.                            Studies of predator foraging behavior typically focus on single prey species and fixed predator densities, ignoring the potential importance of complexities such as predator dilution; predator‐mediated effects of alternative prey; heterospecific competition; or predator–predator interactions. Neglecting the effects of prey density is particularly problematic for prey species that live in mixed species groups, where the beneficial effects of predator dilution may swamp the negative effects of heterospecific competition. Here we use field experiments to investigate how the mortality rates of a shoaling coral reef fish (a wrasse:               Thalassoma amblycephalum               ), change as a result of variation in: 1) conspecific density, 2) density of a predator (a hawkfish:               Paracirrhites arcatus               ), and 3) presence of an alternative prey species that competes for space (a damselfish:               Pomacentrus pavo               ). We quantify changes in prey mortality rates from the predator's perspective, examining the effects of added predators or a second prey species on the predator's functional response. Our analysis highlights a model‐fitting approach that discriminates amongst multiple hypotheses about predator foraging in a community context. Wrasse mortality decreased with increasing conspecific density (i.e. mortality was inversely density‐dependent). The addition of a second predator doubled prey mortality rates, without significantly changing attack rate or handling time – i.e. there was no evidence for predator interference. The presence of a second prey species increased wrasse mortality by 95%; we attribute this increase either to short‐term apparent competition (predator aggregation) or to a decrease in handling time of the predator (e.g. through decreased wrasse vigilance). In this system, 1) prey benefit from intraspecific group living though a reduced predation risk, and 2) the benefit of group living is reduced in the presence of an alternative prey species.","2013-02","2025-09-07 18:13:53","2025-09-07 18:13:53","2025-09-07 18:13:53","171-178","","2","122","","Oikos","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/TH5Y3DIU/Stier et al. - 2013 - Predator density and competition modify the benefits of group formation in a shoaling reef fish.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the implications of multiple co-occurring symbionts on services to a host have rarely been quantified. In this study, we quantified effects of decapod symbionts on removal of sediment from their coral host. Our field survey showed that all common symbionts typically occur as pairs and never at greater abundances. Two species, the crab Trapezia serenei and the shrimp Alpheus lottini, were most common and co-occurred more often than expected by chance. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test for effects of decapod identity and density on sediment removal. Alone, corals removed 10% of sediment, but removal increased to 30% and 48% with the presence of two and four symbionts, respectively. Per-capita effects of symbionts were independent of density and identity. Our results suggest that symbiont density is restricted by intraspecific competition. Thus, increased sediment removal from a coral host can only be achieved by increasing the number of species of symbionts on that coral, even though these species are functionally equivalent. Symbiont diversity plays a key role, not through added functionality but by overcoming density limitation likely imposed by intraspecific mating systems.","2012-04-16","2025-09-07 18:13:54","2025-09-07 18:13:55","2025-09-07 18:13:54","e32079","","4","7","","PLoS ONE","Housekeeping Mutualisms","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/PGVVLYAK/Stier et al. - 2012 - Housekeeping Mutualisms Do More Symbionts Facilitate Host Performance.pdf","","","","Dornhaus, Anna","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Speciﬁcally, models predict that the positive effect of habitat area on prey diversity should decline in the presence of predators, and that predators should modify the partitioning of alpha and beta diversity across patchy landscapes. However, experimental tests of the predicted context dependency in top-down control remain limited. Using a factorial ﬁeld experiment we quantify the effects of a focal predatory ﬁsh species (grouper) and habitat characteristics (patch size, fragmentation) on the partitioning of diversity and assembly of coral reef ﬁsh communities. We found independent effects of groupers and patch characteristics on prey communities. Groupers reduced prey abundance by 50% and gamma diversity by 45%, with a disproportionate removal of rare species relative to common species (64% and 36% reduction, respectively; an oddity effect). Further, there was a 77% reduction in beta diversity. Null model analysis demonstrated that groupers increased the importance of stochastic community assembly relative to patches without groupers. With regard to patch size, larger patches contained more ﬁshes, but a doubling of patch size led to a modest (36%) increase in prey abundance. Patch size had no effect on prey diversity; however, fragmented patches had 50% higher species richness and modiﬁed species composition relative to unfragmented patches.

Results from a stochastic simulation model illustrate how decreasing within-patch sample size may either increase or decrease observed beta diversity, depending on the type of metric, sample size, and community properties; these changes are easy to understand, and predict, by considering the effects of sampling on variance.

Conservationists seeking to minimize region-wide variability in resources and reduce extinction risk often seek to preserve a metapopulation portfolio of spatially asynchronous subpopulations connected by dispersal. However, portfolio properties are not necessarily static, and the erosion of a portfolio can fundamentally alter the population dynamics and services a species provides. In the Northeast Paciﬁc, a portfolio of spatially asynchronous herring populations has historically provided regional reliability of herring to mobile predators and commercial ﬁshermen as well as local subsistence and ceremonial harvest. Here, we ﬁt a mechanistic time-series model to herring spawn and catch records from 1950 to 2015 to quantify how population growth, climate, and ﬁshing have contributed to a major shift in the herring portfolio over time. We document the erosion of the herring portfolio and a severe decline in herring population growth. Commercial harvest historically played a key role in herring dynamics, hovering around typical annual exploitation rates (15%) at the archipelago scale, but local harvest rates were much higher when ﬁshing occurred (as high as 65%). Additionally, the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation and population growth had equally strong effects on local and regional herring population dynamics. Our results highlight how spatially structured populations can undergo major shifts following disturbance and emphasize how ecological systems do not always rapidly recover and provide services following disturbance. Developing herring management strategies at a ﬁner scale may ensure greater regional resource reliability by recovering previous levels of spatial population asynchrony. However, doing so may require higher implementation and monitoring costs in order to yield higher ecological, social, and economic beneﬁts. Such place-based solutions that match the spatial scale of governance to the spatial scale of ecological dynamics have the potential to improve future management and conservation in an increasingly dynamic world.","2020-11","2025-09-07 18:14:02","2025-09-07 18:14:02","2025-09-07 18:14:02","e03283","","11","11","","Ecosphere","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/JTJRWTUL/Stier et al. - 2020 - Fishing, environment, and the erosion of a population portfolio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, temporal variation in dispersal due to seasonality, weather, and other stochastic forces is an understudied aspect of the dispersal–diversity relationship. Metacommunity theory predicts temporal variation in dispersal can alter species distributions across patches. We empirically tested the hypothesis that variation in dispersal can modify the nonlinear dispersal–diversity relationship. Using a mesocosm experiment, we factorially manipulated variation in and intensity of dispersal in invertebrate grazer communities associated with nearshore seagrass ecosystems. Higher dispersal intensity led to higher grazer abundance, higher species richness (alpha diversity), and — when dispersal was variable — lower compositional similarity among patches (higher beta diversity). Within each dispersal intensity treatment level, temporal variation in dispersal decreased alpha diversity and increased beta diversity, with strongest effects at low- and intermediate-intensity dispersal. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that temporal variation in dispersal can substantially modify the well-described dispersal–diversity relationship for both alpha and beta diversity. Broadly, our results provide increasing evidence for the effects of spatial and temporal variability in modifying the role of the ecological processes driving marine metacommunity structure.","2019-03-21","2025-09-07 18:14:04","2025-09-07 18:14:04","2025-09-07 18:14:04","67-76","","","613","","Mar.

Here, we evaluate how the value of monitoring information increases as a natural resource spends more time near the critical threshold. This benefit emerges because higher monitoring precision promotes higher yield and a greater capacity to recover from overharvest. We show that precautionary buffers that trigger increased monitoring precision as resource levels decline may offer a way to minimize monitoring costs and maximize profits.

This “trophic downgrading” has generated widespread concern because of the fundamental role that apex predators can play in ecosystem functioning, disease regulation, and biodiversity maintenance. In attempts to combat declines, managers have conducted reintroductions, imposed stricter harvest regulations, and implemented protected areas. We suggest that full recovery of viable apex predator populations is currently the exception rather than the rule. We argue that, in addition to well-known considerations, such as continued exploitation and slow life histories, there are several underappreciated factors that complicate predator recoveries. These factors include three challenges. First, a priori identification of the suite of trophic interactions, such as resource limitation and competition that will influence recovery can be difficult. Second, defining and accomplishing predator recovery in the context of a dynamic ecosystem requires an appreciation of the timing of recovery, which can determine the relative density of apex predators and other predators and therefore affect competitive outcomes. Third, successful recovery programs require designing adaptive sequences of management strategies that embrace key environmental and species interactions as they emerge. Consideration of recent research on food web modules, alternative stable states, and community assembly offer important insights for predator recovery efforts and restoration ecology more generally. Foremost among these is the importance of a social-ecological perspective in facilitating a long-lasting predator restoration while avoiding unintended consequences.","2016-05-06","2025-09-07 18:14:09","2025-09-07 18:14:09","2025-09-07 18:14:09","e1501769","","5","2","","Sci.

In particular, the paradigm for strong, directly density-dependent (DDD) postsettlement mortality stands in contrast to recent evidence for inversely density-dependent (IDD) mortality. We review the processes responsible for DDD and IDD per capita mortality in reef ﬁshes, noting that the pattern observed depends on predator and prey behavior, the spatial conﬁguration of the reef habitat, and the spatial and temporal scales of observation. Speciﬁcally, predators tend to produce DDD prey mortality at their characteristic spatial scale of foraging, but prey mortality is IDD at smaller spatial scales due to attack-abatement effects (e.g., risk dilution). As a result, DDD mortality may be more common than IDD mortality on patch reefs, which tend to constrain predator foraging to the same scale as prey aggregation, eliminating attack-abatement effects. Additionally, adjacent groups of prey on continuous reefs may share a subset of refuges, increasing per capita refuge availability and relaxing DDD mortality relative to prey on patch reefs, where the patch edge could prevent such refuge sharing. These hypotheses lead to a synthetic framework to predict expected mortality patterns for a variety of scenarios. For nonsocial, nonaggregating species and species that aggregate in order to take advantage of spatially clumped refuges, IDD mortality is possible but likely superseded by DDD refuge competition, especially on patch reefs. By contrast, for species that aggregate socially, mortality should be IDD at the scale of individual aggregations but DDD at larger scales. The results of nearly all prior reef ﬁsh studies ﬁt within this framework, although additional work is needed to test many of the predicted outcomes. This synthesis reconciles some apparent contradictions in the recent reef ﬁsh literature and suggests the importance of accounting for the scale-sensitive details of predator and prey behavior in any study system.","2010-07","2025-09-07 18:14:12","2025-09-07 18:14:12","2025-09-07 18:14:12","1949-1961","","7","91","","Ecology","Synthesizing mechanisms of density dependence in reef fishes","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/TD9VRTZY/White et al. - 2010 - Synthesizing mechanisms of density dependence in reef fishes behavior, habitat configuration, and o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A common question with such models is how changes to a parameter value or functional form in the model alter the results. Some authors have chosen to answer that question using frequentist statistical hypothesis tests (e.g. ANOVA). This is inappropriate for two reasons. First, p‐values are determined by statistical power (i.e. replication), which can be arbitrarily high in a simulation context, producing minuscule p‐values regardless of the effect size. Second, the null hypothesis of no difference between treatments (e.g. parameter values) is known a priori to be false, invalidating the premise of the test. Use of p‐values is troublesome (rather than simply irrelevant) because small p‐values lend a false sense of importance to observed differences. We argue that modelers should abandon this practice and focus on evaluating the magnitude of differences between simulations.                            Synthesis                          Researchers analyzing field or lab data often test ecological hypotheses using frequentist statistics (t‐tests, ANOVA, etc.) that focus on p‐values. Field and lab data usually have limited sample sizes, and p‐values are valuable for quantifying the probability of making incorrect inferences in that situation. However, modern ecologists increasingly rely on simulation models to address complex questions, and those who were trained in frequentist statistics often apply the hypothesis‐testing approach inappropriately to their simulation results. Our paper explains why p‐values are not informative for interpreting simulation models, and suggests better ways to evaluate the ecological significance of model results.","2014-04","2025-09-07 18:14:13","2025-09-07 18:14:14","2025-09-07 18:14:13","385-388","","4","123","","Oikos","","","","","","","","en","CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/adrianstiermbp2023/Zotero/storage/SASUF9TS/White et al. - 2014 - Ecologists should not use statistical significance tests to interpret simulation model results.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we synthesise empirical literature and theory to create a novel framework for examining the range of behaviourally mediated pathways through which human activities may affect different ecosystem functions. We highlight the few empirical studies that show the potential realisation of some of these pathways, but also identify numerous factors that can dampen or prevent ultimate ecosystem consequences. Without a deeper understanding of these pathways, we risk wasting valuable resources on mitigating behavioural effects with little ecological relevance, or conversely mismanaging situations in which behavioural effects do drive ecosystem change.

However, herbivore biomass targets assume grazing behavior is consistent across different reef systems, even though relatively few have been studied. We document grazing behavior of two scarid species in Antigua, Barbuda, and Bonaire. Our analyses show significant differences in intraspecific feeding rates, time spent grazing, and intensity of grazing across sites, which may alter the ecological impact of a given scarid population. We suggest several hypothesized mechanisms for these behavioral variations that would benefit from explicit testing in future research.
