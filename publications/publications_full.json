The excep- tional biodiversity of these ecosystems can be attributed not only to the immense diversity of coral species, but also to the multitude of fish and invertebrate species that depend on these individual colonies, coral reefs, and the resources they provide (Bellwood et al. 2017; Siqueira et al. 2023). However, these coral reef ecosystems are facing increas- ing threats from a range of disturbances (e.g., pollution, overfishing, and climate change), causing the widespread destruction of the world’s coral reefs (Eddy et al. 2021). The importance of hard corals to their fish and invertebrate occupants is evident; loss of coral quantity, quality, and/ or complexity can affect fish and invertebrate biodiversity, abundance, and species composition (Beukers and Jones 1997; Jones et al. 2004; Bonin et al. 2011; Stier et al. 2014; Pratchett et al. 2020). There is also growing recognition of the reciprocal benefits that fishes and invertebrates offer to these corals (Stier and Osenberg 2024a). Such benefits may help buffer corals against natural and human-induced stress- ors, enhancing their resilience to changing environmental conditions (Toby Kiers et al. 2010). Comprehending these symbiotic relationships and their effects on coral biology not only deepens our understanding of the mutualistic networks that may have sustained coral reefs historically, but also offers insights into harnessing these positive interactions to enhance restoration efforts on reefs (Shaver and Silliman Abstract On coral reefs, hard corals (order Scleractinia) provide habitat for an extraordinary diversity of reef fishes, many of which have close associations with the coral. Coral can provide these fishes nesting sites, food and protec- tion from predators. The fishes can also benefit the corals, through fish-derived services resulting from, for example, diurnal and nocturnal movements, foraging, and nutrient excretion. Here, we synthesize how coral-associated fishes (i.e., coral reef fishes that have prolonged or permanent dependency on live coral) positively contribute to the health and resilience of corals. We highlight how certain coral- associated fishes offer a variety of benefits to corals, includ- ing enhanced oxygenation, nutrient subsidies and recycling, sediment removal, and protection against predators and para- sites. Our review highlights the critical role that some coral- associated fishes have in supporting reef function, and in some cases, conferring resilience. * Adrian C. Stier astier@ucsb.edu Tory J.

In this paper, we focus on the positive effects of coral- associated fishes, which we define as species that maintain close spatial relationships with live coral structures, using them for shelter, feeding, breeding, or territorial defense. These associations range from obligate coral dwellers, which spend nearly their entire life within coral colonies such as damselfishes and gobies, to facultative species that use corals opportunistically or for shelter such as grunts and snappers (Fig. 1). Territorial species like farmerfish also interact with corals by colonizing live corals and then cultivating algae within their territories, which leads to the demise of some corals but facilitation of others (White and O’Donnell 2010). We highlight the multifac- eted ways coral-associated fishes positively affect corals including: enhancing oxygenation, nutrient cycling, sedi- ment removal, and predator defense, and mitigating the deleterious effects of disease, parasites, and macroalgae (Fig. 2). We then examine how these fish-mediated effects may interact with and potentially alleviate the harmful impacts of marine heatwaves. Lastly, we emphasize the need for a more mechanistic understanding of these fish- coral relationships, and discuss their implications for the conservation and restoration of coral reef ecosystems. Fish‑derived services to the coral holobiont Below, we briefly review the major ways in which fishes can benefit the coral holobiont. We emphasize the coral holobiont because many of the proposed mechanisms by which fish benefit corals are mediated through effects on their symbiotic algae or their microbiome, rather than being limited to effects on the coral tissue only. We also emphasize beneficial effects instead of direct deleterious effects (like consumption of coral tissue), and we do not discuss indirect effects of herbivores on corals via reduc- tions in macroalgal biomass, as these interactions are not directly tied to coral-fish interactions and have been cov- ered extensively in other reviews (Ledlie et al. 2007). Fig. 1 Examples of coral-asso- ciated fishes and corals, includ- ing (a) damselfishes (Dascyllus arunaus and other species) and their host coral, Acropora sp., in Okinawa, and b farmerfish (Stegastes nigricans) defend- ing its territory of turf algae lawns with scleractinian corals, c diurnal aggregations of Hae- mulon flavolineatum (grunts) in the Caribbean (Photos: Adobe Stock) Coral Reefs Oxygenation and water flow Coral-associated fishes may play a key role in oxygenating and increasing water flow around the surface of branching corals which is vital to the metabolism of corals and their symbiotic algae (Nelson and Altieri 2019). This process may be particularly key at night, when the center of a branch- ing coral can become anoxic due to a lack of water flow, in combination with respiration by the coral in the absence of photosynthesis by Symbiodiniacea (Shashar et al. 1993). An early study Goldshmid et al. (2004) initially discovered ven- tilation by three coral-associated fishes: Dascyllus margina- tus, Dascyllus aruanus, and Chromis viridis. Two additional studies provide key insights into the effects of this oxygena- tion on coral biology. For example, Berenshtein et al. (2015) studied the contribution of damselfishes to coral oxygena- tion at night. These fishes, while largely inactive during the night, continue to hover in a sleep-like state within the coral matrix. This activity maintains a continuous flow of water across the coral surface, enhancing gas exchange, reducing the diffusive boundary layers and thereby improving oxygen- ation of the coral (Goldshmid et al. 2004; Berenshtein et al. 2015). Beneficial effects of fish-induced water movement are also apparent during the day: e.g., Garcia-Herrera et al. (2017) found that one of these same coral-dwelling damself- ish Dascyllus marginatus increased coral photosynthesis by 3–6% via fish ventilation. This body of work is particularly relevant to corals of today and the future because hypoxia is increasing on many coral reefs, which can have devastating effects on corals and their occupants (Altieri et al. 2017; Hughes et al. 2020; Pezner et al. 2023), and fishes can help mitigate those effects. Nutrient cycling and subsidy Reef fishes provide concentrated nutrients to corals by forag- ing in the water column or on the seafloor, and then return- ing to shelter in the coral reef, where they egest and excrete nutrients (Allgeier et al. 2017). Fish excretion and feces pro- vide macro- and micro-nutrients, although the composition and concentration of these nutrients vary among fish spe- cies and trophic guilds (Van Wert et al. 2023). Ammonium (NH 4 + ), which is the most readily available form of nitrogen for the coral holobiont, is one of the most important nutri- ents excreted by fishes (Allgeier et al. 2017). Fish excretion increases the availability of ammonium to the coral and its Symbiodiniacea (Shantz et al. 2023) affecting reef biogeo- chemical cycles and increasing coral growth (Allgeier et al. 2017). Early work on large schools of grunts (Haemulidae) in the Caribbean showed that grunts foraged away from reefs at night, but hovered near and around corals during the day (Meyer et al. 1983; Meyer and Schultz 1985a, b). These migrating fish schools provided essential nutrients (includ- ing nitrogen and phosphorus) to corals, which enhanced the density of Symbiodiniacea and consequently increased coral growth (Meyer et al. 1983; Meyer and Schultz 1985a, b). More recent work has shown that these grunt shoals increase the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus around corals by tenfold, causing increases in crustose cor- alline algae but reductions in macroalgae, and leading to a 75% increases in growth of Acropora cervicornis (Shantz et al. 2015). The reduction in nutrient-limited macroalgae was not predicted, but reefs occupied by schools of grunts had substantially higher rates of grazing by herbivores, which mitigated any potential benefit of nutrient addition on Fig. 2 Positive interactions between coral-associated fishes and their coral hosts.

Crabs in the family Trapeziidae (Figure 1) are small crustaceans that have a specialized association with caulifl ower corals in the genus Pocillopora and some other branching corals in the tropical Pacifi c Ocean. The over 20 species of Trapeziid crab live within the branches of coral colonies, have a symbiotic relationship with their host corals and are so dependent on their coral host for food and shelter that they cannot survive outside of their host. Many species of these crabs occur primarily as male– female pairs within their coral colony, with the number of pairs often increasing as the size of the coral colony increases. Trapeziid species, while superfi cially similar, vary in size, color pattern, and claw morphology, presumably refl ecting differences in the size and shape of corals they occupy and the services they provide to corals. What services are these? Trapeziid crabs act as guardians of, and housekeepers for, corals, thus increasing the growth and survival of their host. For example, the crown- of-thorns sea star (Acanthaster planci) and the pincushion star (Culcita novaeguineae) are voracious corallivores that can devastate coral reefs. Trapeziid crabs will attack these predators, which are much larger, and protect the coral from being eaten. The crabs also defend the coral against snails that graze on coral tissue, such as Drupella cornus and Coralliophila violacea. However, predators are not the only threat to corals — they can also be harmed by the deposition of sediments on the coral surface. Fortunately, the crabs also are good housekeepers, removing sediment from the coral, and further increasing coral growth and survival. By actively defending and cleaning their coral hosts, Trapeziid crabs play a crucial role in maintaining the health and survival of the coral colonies they inhabit and thus the persistence of coral reefs. Quick guide Why do Trapeziid crabs protect their coral? The fate of Trapeziid and their coral hosts is entwined, as is true in other symbiotic relationships that are mutually benefi cial to both participants. The crabs cannot live outside of their host coral. In fact, most Trapeziids are restricted to living in a single species (or genus) of coral. The coral colonies provide the crabs with shelter and a constant food supply — coral tissue, mucus and lipid bodies, which the crabs obtain by agitating and scraping the coral with their claws. In exchange, the crabs provide the coral with crucial protection from predators and sedimentation that could kill the entire colony. If the coral dies, the crabs either die or must fi nd a new host, which can involve risk of predation even if a new host is available and not occupied by other crabs. Thus, by protecting their coral host, Trapeziid crabs create a stable environment that helps ensure their own survival and successful reproduction. The evolution of this mutualism has not only facilitated the diversifi cation of the crabs, but it also functions secondarily to facilitate the vast diversity of organisms that depend on the complex coral reef ecosystem. But how effectively can a small crab protect a coral? Even though predatory sea stars are many times larger than the crabs, the crabs can effectively protect their host coral from these predators, much as tiny ants protect Acacia trees from elephants and other large herbivores. The crabs use their powerful claws to shove the sea star and pinch their tube feet. These behaviors deter or reduce the feeding activities of the sea stars, which could otherwise eat an entire colony in a single night. Similarly, the removal of sediment is not merely for appearances, but is critical to the survival of the coral; when researchers remove crabs from corals in coastal regions with high sedimentation rates, corals die, but when crabs are present the corals survive. While the effectiveness of Trapeziid defense can vary depending on factors, such as crab species and size, predator abundance and sedimentation rates, their role as defenders contributes signifi cantly to the resilience and survival of their coral hosts and thus the diversity of coral reef ecosystems. Does hosting Trapeziids cost the coral? In some mutualisms (e.g., ants Magazine R6 Current Biology 34, R1–R15, January 8, 2024 ll and acacias; or pollinators and plants), one partner pays a small price in return for the greater rewards it receives. Trapeziid crabs, as mutualists of coral, generally impose a relatively low cost on their host colonies. Although they consume small amounts of coral tissue (which can reduce coral growth in the absence of predators and sediments), their feeding behavior primarily targets damaged or dying tissue rather than healthy portions. Some studies suggest that their feeding activities may even benefi t the coral by removing potential sites for infection or disease. While Trapeziid crabs occupy space within the coral branches, their presence does not appear to greatly impede the growth or reproduction of the coral. The benefi ts provided by the crabs typically greatly outweigh any potential harm caused by their feeding or space occupation. Are all Trapeziids good defenders? No. While Trapeziid crabs, as a group, are known for their defensive behaviors and their role in protecting their coral hosts, the effectiveness of individual crabs can vary. Variation in size, claw morphology and genotype can affect their defensive capabilities. Larger and stronger crabs may have more formidable claws and may be better equipped to deter predators. Additionally, there can be geographic and individual variation within a species — crabs in different regions or individuals within a population may exhibit different levels of defense. The relative magnitude of costs and benefi ts can also vary depending on factors such as predator prevalence, coral species, and overall ecological context. Do Trapeziids have effects beyond their coral? Yes. By defending their coral hosts against corallivores, Trapeziid crabs indirectly support the survival and growth of coral colonies. Healthy coral populations provide essential habitat and food sources for numerous other reef organisms, including fi sh, invertebrates and other invertebrate symbionts. Furthermore, the presence of Trapeziid crabs can infl uence the distribution and behavior of other organisms within the reef ecosystem. By protecting their host coral, the Trapeziids can create “halos” of protection around the coral colonies, creating zones of reduced predation pressure. As a result, other nearby corals that don’t harbor crab symbionts may also be protected from predators, facilitating the survival of small fi shes and other invertebrates that rely on the coral and thus benefi t from the services provided by the crabs. Is climate change affecting Trapeziid crabs? As you can see, Trapeziid crabs are intimately linked to the success of corals. But corals are vulnerable to may stressors in addition to predators and sediments. Indeed, global climate change imposes profound risks to corals, which are highly vulnerable to ocean Figure 1. Trapeziid coral crabs within caulifl ower corals. In each picture crabs (Trapezia sp.) are perched embedded between the coral branches, grasping onto the coral with their claws (photos: Thomas Vignaud).

Rising sea temperatures can lead to coral bleaching events and coral death; acidifi cation can reduce coral growth and also lead to their death. These stressors might also affect Trapeziid crabs, even if their host coral isn’t killed. In experiments simulating future climate change, increased water temperature caused reductions in crab abundance and egg production, and caused crabs to expel their mates and other crustaceans that also help defend corals.

The relative magnitude of costs and benefi ts can also vary depending on factors such as predator prevalence, coral species, and overall ecological context. Do Trapeziids have effects beyond their coral? Yes. By defending their coral hosts against corallivores, Trapeziid crabs indirectly support the survival and growth of coral colonies. Healthy coral populations provide essential habitat and food sources for numerous other reef organisms, including fi sh, invertebrates and other invertebrate symbionts. Furthermore, the presence of Trapeziid crabs can infl uence the distribution and behavior of other organisms within the reef ecosystem. By protecting their host coral, the Trapeziids can create “halos” of protection around the coral colonies, creating zones of reduced predation pressure. As a result, other nearby corals that don’t harbor crab symbionts may also be protected from predators, facilitating the survival of small fi shes and other invertebrates that rely on the coral and thus benefi t from the services provided by the crabs. Is climate change affecting Trapeziid crabs? As you can see, Trapeziid crabs are intimately linked to the success of corals. But corals are vulnerable to may stressors in addition to predators and sediments. Indeed, global climate change imposes profound risks to corals, which are highly vulnerable to ocean Figure 1.

Rising sea temperatures can lead to coral bleaching events and coral death; acidifi cation can reduce coral growth and also lead to their death. These stressors might also affect Trapeziid crabs, even if their host coral isn’t killed. In experiments simulating future climate change, increased water temperature caused reductions in crab abundance and egg production, and caused crabs to expel their mates and other crustaceans that also help defend corals.

Rodriguez-Cabal Abstract Standing dead structures of habitat-forming organisms (e.g., dead trees, coral skeletons, oyster shells) killed by a disturbance are material legacies that can affect ecosystem recovery processes. Many ecosystems are subject to different types of disturbance that either remove biogenic structures or leave them intact. Here we used a mathematical model to quantify how the resil- ience of coral reef ecosystems may be differentially affected following structure-removing and structure-retaining disturbance events, focusing in particular on the potential for regime shifts from coral to macroalgae. We found that dead coral skeletons could substantially diminish coral resil- ience if they provided macroalgae refuge from herbivory, a key feedback asso- ciated with the recovery of coral populations. Our model shows that the material legacy of dead skeletons broadens the range of herbivore biomass over which coral and macroalgae states are bistable. Hence, material legacies can alter resilience by modifying the underlying relationship between a system driver (herbivory) and a state variable (coral cover). KEYWORDS alternative stable states, coral reefs, disturbance, hysteresis, macroalgae, material legacies, regime shifts, resilience INTRODUCTION Major disturbances, such as fire, drought, storms, and heat waves, can abruptly kill the structure-forming species that create the foundations of ecosystems. When the dead structures of these organisms are left behind, these material legacies can alter recolonization rates and interactions among species in the recovering system (Johnstone et al., 2016). For example, standing or fallen dead trees can affect establishment success of new colonizing individuals in forests (Johnstone et al., 2016), shells of dead oysters can provide substrate for new settling larvae to facilitate recoveries on oyster reefs (Lenihan & Peterson, 1998), and skeletons of dead corals can either serve as settlement substrate or harbor macroalgae that compete with live corals for attachment space on coral reefs (Vieira, 2020). Because material legacies can have powerful effects on ecological processes, they have the potential to Received: 20 April 2022Revised: 9 January 2023Accepted: 19 January 2023 DOI: 10.1002/ecy.4006 This is an open access article under the terms of theCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercialLicense, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes. © 2023 The Authors.Ecologypublished by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of The Ecological Society of America.

For example, if dead structures occupy significant amounts of habitat space for extended durations, these legacies can prolong the time for new colonists to reseed a disturbed area and for that ecosystem to regain its predisturbance condition. Alternatively, if dead structures facilitate colonization by a functionally different guild of organisms, these struc- tures may facilitate a regime shift in ecosystem state. To better understand the role of material legacies, we can directly compare how disturbances that either remove or leave in place dead biogenic structures affect resilience. Some disturbances both kill structure-forming organisms and remove their biogenic structure, opening up unoccupied habitat spaces between surviving individuals (hereafter, structure-removing disturbances). Examples include intense fires, floods, storms (Fukami, 2015), defor- estation, landslides, avalanches (Swanson et al., 2011), dredging, and ice scour (Lenihan & Peterson, 1998). By contrast, other disturbances kill structure-forming organisms but leave their structures intact, resulting in patchworks of live and dead organisms or dense stands of dead individuals that can restrict the amount of unoccu- pied space for new colonists and surviving individuals (hereafter, structure-retaining disturbances). Examples include drought, disease, predator or pest outbreaks (Johnstone et al., 2016), thermal stress (e.g., heat waves; Folke et al., 2004), and hypoxic events (Lenihan & Peterson, 1998). In this study, we use a model to quantify how the resilience of coral reef ecosystems may be differentially affected following structure-removing and structure- retaining disturbance events. Coral reefs serve as a timely model system to explore the effects of material legacies on resilience. Disturbance regimes are changing such that acute events that either remove or retain structure are increasing in frequency, severity, or both (Oliver et al., 2018; Uthicke et al.,2015; Wehner et al., 2018). For example, structure-removing events (e.g., tropical storms) appear to be increasing in intensity (Vecchi et al., 2021), while structure-retaining events (e.g., marine heat waves that cause coral bleaching, predator/disease outbreaks) are becoming more wide- spread, frequent, and severe (Hughes et al., 2017;Lough et al., 2018; Pratchett et al.,2013). Storm disturbances can remove the entire coral colony, creating planar reef sur- faces (Gardner et al., 2005), whereas structure-retaining disturbances kill the soft tissue of corals while leaving their skeletons intact (Baker et al., 2008;Pratchettetal.,2013). Coral taxa that are most sensitive to both disturbance types tend to have greater structural complexity (e.g., branching, corymbose, and tabular colony morphologies), but how their dead structures influence the recovery potential of reefs remains poorly understood. Some disturbances can tip a coral reef ecosystem from a coral-dominated state to one where macroalgae or other benthic taxa are the more common space holder (Schmitt et al., 2022). There is mounting empirical and theoretical evidence supporting the idea that these can be alternative basins of attraction (alternative stable states in models) when hysteresis cre- ates a region of bistability that includes the ambient envi- ronmental conditions (Briggs et al., 2018; Folke et al., 2004; McManus et al.,2019;Mumby,2006; Mumby et al., 2013; Muthukrishnan et al.,2016; Schmitt et al.,2019; Schröder et al., 2005). Yet the resilience of coral to distur- bance is tremendously variable across coral reef ecosys- tems, with rapid recovery in some reefs and continued coral decline or shifts to macroalgae in others (Baumann et al., 2022;Holbrooketal.,2018). The presence or type of material legacies has the potential to account for some of the observed variability in resilience of coral following a disturbance. Competing hypotheses exist regarding the role of dead coral structures in fostering return of coral on dis- turbed tropical reefs. High structural complexity can pro- mote faster or more successful recovery of corals if it provides habitat for coral-associated organisms that bene- fit coral growth and/or settlement substrate with refuge spaces for colonizing corals that would otherwise be con- sumed by predators (Graham et al., 2015). Alternatively, the retention of dead coral skeletons may diminish coral resilience if skeletons facilitate the establishment of macroalgae—major competitors of coral for attachment space on the reef—by, for example, creating physical refugia from herbivores for vulnerable, early-life-stage macroalgae (Bennett et al., 2010; Puk et al.,2020). Indeed, flat reef surfaces are readily grazed by herbivorous fish and sea urchins, preventing the establishment of macroalgae (Adam et al., 2011,2015; Bellwood et al.,2006;Holbrook et al., 2016). This grazing helps maintain reef surfaces in a suitable condition for the settlement of new coral colonies and, thus, can be a crucial stabilizing feedback during periods of coral reef recovery (Adam et al., 2015; Holbrook et al., 2016; Schmitt et al.,2022). Following reductions in herbivory, some coral reefs have transitioned to a degraded ecosystem state in which macroalgae become the dominant space holder (Hughes, 1994; Mumby et al.,2013; Vieira, 2020). Once mature, macroalgae can become phys- ically and/or chemically defended against herbivory (Davis, 2018) and compete directly with corals for reef space by overgrowing live colonies and preempting settlement space for coral larvae (McCook et al., 2001; Vieira, 2020). This suggests that macroalgae that are ini- tially protected by dead coral structures could persist on the reef well after the dead structures have completely eroded away, potentially trapping the system in the alter- native, macroalgae-dominated state. 2of15KOPECKYET AL. 19399170, 0, Downloaded from https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.4006 by University Of California, Santa Barbara, Wiley Online Library on [13/03/2023].

Photogrammetry is a tool that renders detailed models of landscapes and organ- isms from images, enabling sophisticated examination of habitat structure (Burns et al. 2015; Ferrari et al. 2021). However, photogrammetric applications can be more expen- sive than traditional data collection methods in terms of equipment, time, and training (Young et al. 2017; Couch et al. 2021; Urbina-Barreto et al. 2021). Despite such costs, photogrammetric measurements of basic habitat character- istics may be very similar to data collected using traditional surveys (Raoult et al. 2016; Million et al. 2021). Studies that explicitly measure the same ecological phenomena using photogrammetry and manual approaches are therefore needed to critically examine the benefits of this emerging technique. Photogrammetry may provide an especially useful research tool in settings where interactions among animals and structurally complex habitats govern ecosystem func- tion, such as coral reefs (Burns et al. 2015; Lavy et al. 2015). For example, photogrammetry has helped to measure con- nections between reef habitat and fish communities (Gon- zalez-Rivero et al. 2017; Urbina-Barreto et al. 2020), assess patterns in coral growth (Ferrari et al. 2017; Conley and Hollander 2021), and generate novel descriptions of coral geometry (Reichert et al. 2017; Aston et al. 2022). Among studies that have included both manual and photogrammet- ric measurements, most have focused on the accuracy of Abstract Photogrammetry is an emerging tool that allows scientists to measure important habitat characteristics of coral reefs at multiple spatial scales. However, the ecologi- cal benefits of using photogrammetry to measure reef habitat have rarely been assessed through direct comparison to tra- ditional methods, especially in settings where manual meas- urements are more feasible and affordable. Here, we applied multiple methods to measure coral colonies (Pocillopora spp.) and asked whether photogrammetric or manual obser- vations better describe short-term colony growth and links between colony size and the biodiversity of coral-dwelling fishes and invertebrates. Using photogrammetry, we meas- ured patterns in changes in coral volume that were other- wise obscured by high variation from manual measure- ments. Additionally, we found that photogrammetry-based estimates of colony skeletal volume best predicted the abun- dance and richness of animals living within the coral. This study highlights that photogrammetry can improve descrip- tions of coral colony size, growth, and associated biodiver- sity compared to manual measurements.

However, few studies have quantified dif- ferences in analogous ecological measurements derived from photogrammetric and traditional measurements of reef habi- tat, likely because photogrammetry is often used to describe large-scale characteristics when no practical manual equiva- lent is available (Reichert et al. 2017; Aston et al. 2022). Some direct comparisons of ecological interpretations derived from manual and photogrammetric approaches indicate that photogrammetry can provide more accurate estimates of coral growth (Kikuzawa et al. 2018; Con- ley and Hollander 2021) and stronger predictions of links between fish biodiversity and reef-scale habitat complexity (Gonzalez-Rivero et al. 2017). However, photogrammetric measurements do not always lead to different conclusions than comparable field-based estimates. For example, Mil- lion et al. (2021) measured nearly identical colony growth using photogrammetric and manual methodologies, while Agudo-Adriani et al. (2016) observed that simple, manu- ally measurable colony features drove more variation in fish communities than complex, photogrammetry-derived habitat characteristics. In this paper we explore whether photogrammetry improves measurements of growth and habitat provision- ing of branching cauliflower corals (Pocillopora spp.) over traditional approaches. Specifically, we asked: (1) Do manual or photogrammetric methods better describe short- term, volumetric growth across a range of coral sizes, and (2) Does photogrammetry improve our ability to predict the abundance and biodiversity of coral-associated animal communities? Methods We collected data in Moorea, French Polynesia, as part of a study of feedbacks between Pocillopora spp. and coral- associated fishes and invertebrates (CAFI). Although CAFI diversity and abundance have been shown to increase with host colony size, these relationships were previously mod- eled using coarse geometric measurements (Caley et al. 2001). We hypothesized that photogrammetry would better quantify linkages between coral volume and CAFI commu- nity characteristics. We initiated an experiment in August 2019 consisting of 60 Pocillopora colonies (5–50 cm diameter). Corals were removed from the reef and sorted into control (n = 30) and CAFI-removal treatments (n = 30), then deployed into an experimental array (see Supplement). Directly after deployment, we measured coral size using both manual and photogrammetric approaches (Fig. S1). For manual meas- urements, a single observer used a flexible tape to estimate colony length (L, longest horizontal axis), width (W, longest perpendicular measurement to length), and height (H, per- pendicular to L and W). We calculated manual coral volume as a hemi-ellipsoid: a measurement previously used to relate Pocillopora spp. volume to CAFI biodiversity (Caley et al. 2001; McKeon et al. 2012). For photogrammetric measurements, we used Agisoft Metashape (v1.6.2; Agisoft LLC, St. Petersburg, Russia) to create 3D models of coral colonies, following the protocol outlined by Ferrari et al. (2017). Full details are outlined in the Supplement, and in our online protocol (https:// github. com/ stier- lab/ Stier- Coral- Morph ometr ics- 2020). Using our complete and isolated 3D models, we estimated skeletal volume (V skeleton ), as well as length, width and height of each colony in Metashape. From photogrammetric linear dimensions we calculated photogrammetric ellipsoid volume (V photo_ellipsoid ) to directly approximate manual volumetric measurements (V ellipsoid ). We also used Meshlab (v2020.06; Cignoni et al. 2008) to estimate convex hull volume (V hull ), the size of the smallest convex 3D object that can encase a coral colony. Convex hulls provided an additional semi-ellip- tical measurement of exterior coral volume, but one that is not based on geometric calculation from multiple observer- based component measurements. To assess coral growth, we remeasured colonies after 105 days in December 2019 using the same observers. We excluded six corals (of 60) from all analyses which did not yield high-quality photogrammetric models, due largely to incomplete photo coverage and turbidity. We also excluded 21 colonies from growth measurements that by December had experienced partial mortality or attracted dense fish aggregations which obscured the coral in pho- tographs. In total, we analyzed n = 33 colonies for coral growth (measured at both time points) and n = 26 colonies to link CAFI biodiversity and coral volume (using data from August). Analysis We estimated growth as the proportional change in volume, calculated as (V i,December – V i,August )/V i,August where i repre- sents measurement method (manual ellipsoid, photogram- metric ellipsoid, hull, or skeleton). We used correlation analysis to compare manual and photogrammetric estimates of colony size and growth. We compared mean growth esti- mates using a repeated-measures ANOVA with a Green- house–Geisser correction and a post hoc Tukey HSD test (Bathke et al. 2009). We measured whether August colony volume predicted growth by performing linear regression (1) V ellipsoid = 4 3 휋 L 2 W 2 H 2 Coral Reefs 1 3 on colony-wise growth and initial volume measurements. To measure the link between colony volume and CAFI bio- diversity, we performed power-law regressions of CAFI abundance and richness against all four volumetric meas- urements (see Supplement). We compared goodness of fit among regressions of the same response variable using AIC and root mean square error (RMSE) values (Chai and Drax- ler 2014). We performed analyses using R v3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2022) at a significance threshold of α = 0.05. Results and discussion Manual measurements of colony size and volume were strongly correlated to photogrammetric measurements (Table S1; Fig. S2). In contrast, manual growth estimates (V ellipsoid ) were not correlated with any of the three photo- grammetric growth estimates, whereas all three photogram- metric estimates of growth were positively correlated with each ",

Yet across taxa, interaction strength is strongly related to predator size, prey size and prey density, suggesting that general cross‐taxonomic relationships could be used to predict how strongly individual species interact.\n\nHere, we ask how accurately do general size‐scaling relationships predict variation in interaction strength between specific species that vary in size and density across space and time?\n\nTo address this question, we quantified the size and density dependence of the functional response of the California spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus, foraging on a key ecosystem engineer, the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, in experimental mesocosms. Based on these results, we then estimated variation in lobster–urchin interaction strength across five sites and 9 years of observational data. Finally, we compared our experimental estimates to predictions based on general size‐scaling relationships from the literature.\n\nOur results reveal that predator and prey body size has the greatest effect on interaction strength when prey abundance is high. Due to consistently high urchin densities in the field, our simulations suggest that body size—relative to density—accounted for up to 87% of the spatio‐temporal variation in interaction strength. However, general size‐scaling relationships failed to predict the magnitude of interactions between lobster and urchin; even the best prediction from the literature was, on average, an order of magnitude (+18.7×) different than our experimental predictions.\n\nHarvest and climate change are driving reductions in the average body size of many marine species. Anticipating how reductions in body size will alter species interactions is critical to managing marine systems in an ecosystem context. Our results highlight the extent to which differences in size‐frequency distributions can drive dramatic variation in the strength of interactions across narrow spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, our work suggests that species‐specific estimates for the scaling of interaction strength with body size, rather than general size‐scaling relationships, are necessary to quantitatively predict how reductions in body size will alter interaction strengths.",
    "plainSummary": "Abstract How strongly predators and prey interact is both notoriously context dependent and difficult to measure. Yet across taxa, interaction strength is strongly related to predator size, prey size and prey density, suggesting that general cross‐taxonomic relationships could be used to predict how strongly individual species interact. Here, we ask how accurately do general size‐scaling relationships predict variation in interaction strength between specific species that vary in size and density across space and time?",

Rodriguez-Cabal Abstract Standing dead structures of habitat-forming organisms (e.g., dead trees, coral skeletons, oyster shells) killed by a disturbance are material legacies that can affect ecosystem recovery processes. Many ecosystems are subject to different types of disturbance that either remove biogenic structures or leave them intact. Here we used a mathematical model to quantify how the resil- ience of coral reef ecosystems may be differentially affected following structure-removing and structure-retaining disturbance events, focusing in particular on the potential for regime shifts from coral to macroalgae. We found that dead coral skeletons could substantially diminish coral resil- ience if they provided macroalgae refuge from herbivory, a key feedback asso- ciated with the recovery of coral populations. Our model shows that the material legacy of dead skeletons broadens the range of herbivore biomass over which coral and macroalgae states are bistable. Hence, material legacies can alter resilience by modifying the underlying relationship between a system driver (herbivory) and a state variable (coral cover). KEYWORDS alternative stable states, coral reefs, disturbance, hysteresis, macroalgae, material legacies, regime shifts, resilience INTRODUCTION Major disturbances, such as fire, drought, storms, and heat waves, can abruptly kill the structure-forming species that create the foundations of ecosystems. When the dead structures of these organisms are left behind, these material legacies can alter recolonization rates and interactions among species in the recovering system (Johnstone et al., 2016). For example, standing or fallen dead trees can affect establishment success of new colonizing individuals in forests (Johnstone et al., 2016), shells of dead oysters can provide substrate for new settling larvae to facilitate recoveries on oyster reefs (Lenihan & Peterson, 1998), and skeletons of dead corals can either serve as settlement substrate or harbor macroalgae that compete with live corals for attachment space on coral reefs (Vieira, 2020). Because material legacies can have powerful effects on ecological processes, they have the potential to Received: 20 April 2022Revised: 9 January 2023Accepted: 19 January 2023 DOI: 10.1002/ecy.4006 This is an open access article under the terms of theCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercialLicense, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes. © 2023 The Authors.Ecologypublished by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of The Ecological Society of America.

For example, if dead structures occupy significant amounts of habitat space for extended durations, these legacies can prolong the time for new colonists to reseed a disturbed area and for that ecosystem to regain its predisturbance condition. Alternatively, if dead structures facilitate colonization by a functionally different guild of organisms, these struc- tures may facilitate a regime shift in ecosystem state. To better understand the role of material legacies, we can directly compare how disturbances that either remove or leave in place dead biogenic structures affect resilience. Some disturbances both kill structure-forming organisms and remove their biogenic structure, opening up unoccupied habitat spaces between surviving individuals (hereafter, structure-removing disturbances). Examples include intense fires, floods, storms (Fukami, 2015), defor- estation, landslides, avalanches (Swanson et al., 2011), dredging, and ice scour (Lenihan & Peterson, 1998). By contrast, other disturbances kill structure-forming organisms but leave their structures intact, resulting in patchworks of live and dead organisms or dense stands of dead individuals that can restrict the amount of unoccu- pied space for new colonists and surviving individuals (hereafter, structure-retaining disturbances). Examples include drought, disease, predator or pest outbreaks (Johnstone et al., 2016), thermal stress (e.g., heat waves; Folke et al., 2004), and hypoxic events (Lenihan & Peterson, 1998). In this study, we use a model to quantify how the resilience of coral reef ecosystems may be differentially affected following structure-removing and structure- retaining disturbance events. Coral reefs serve as a timely model system to explore the effects of material legacies on resilience. Disturbance regimes are changing such that acute events that either remove or retain structure are increasing in frequency, severity, or both (Oliver et al., 2018; Uthicke et al.,2015; Wehner et al., 2018). For example, structure-removing events (e.g., tropical storms) appear to be increasing in intensity (Vecchi et al., 2021), while structure-retaining events (e.g., marine heat waves that cause coral bleaching, predator/disease outbreaks) are becoming more wide- spread, frequent, and severe (Hughes et al., 2017;Lough et al., 2018; Pratchett et al.,2013). Storm disturbances can remove the entire coral colony, creating planar reef sur- faces (Gardner et al., 2005), whereas structure-retaining disturbances kill the soft tissue of corals while leaving their skeletons intact (Baker et al., 2008;Pratchettetal.,2013). Coral taxa that are most sensitive to both disturbance types tend to have greater structural complexity (e.g., branching, corymbose, and tabular colony morphologies), but how their dead structures influence the recovery potential of reefs remains poorly understood. Some disturbances can tip a coral reef ecosystem from a coral-dominated state to one where macroalgae or other benthic taxa are the more common space holder (Schmitt et al., 2022). There is mounting empirical and theoretical evidence supporting the idea that these can be alternative basins of attraction (alternative stable states in models) when hysteresis cre- ates a region of bistability that includes the ambient envi- ronmental conditions (Briggs et al., 2018; Folke et al., 2004; McManus et al.,2019;Mumby,2006; Mumby et al., 2013; Muthukrishnan et al.,2016; Schmitt et al.,2019; Schröder et al., 2005). Yet the resilience of coral to distur- bance is tremendously variable across coral reef ecosys- tems, with rapid recovery in some reefs and continued coral decline or shifts to macroalgae in others (Baumann et al., 2022;Holbrooketal.,2018). The presence or type of material legacies has the potential to account for some of the observed variability in resilience of coral following a disturbance. Competing hypotheses exist regarding the role of dead coral structures in fostering return of coral on dis- turbed tropical reefs. High structural complexity can pro- mote faster or more successful recovery of corals if it provides habitat for coral-associated organisms that bene- fit coral growth and/or settlement substrate with refuge spaces for colonizing corals that would otherwise be con- sumed by predators (Graham et al., 2015). Alternatively, the retention of dead coral skeletons may diminish coral resilience if skeletons facilitate the establishment of macroalgae—major competitors of coral for attachment space on the reef—by, for example, creating physical refugia from herbivores for vulnerable, early-life-stage macroalgae (Bennett et al., 2010; Puk et al.,2020). Indeed, flat reef surfaces are readily grazed by herbivorous fish and sea urchins, preventing the establishment of macroalgae (Adam et al., 2011,2015; Bellwood et al.,2006;Holbrook et al., 2016). This grazing helps maintain reef surfaces in a suitable condition for the settlement of new coral colonies and, thus, can be a crucial stabilizing feedback during periods of coral reef recovery (Adam et al., 2015; Holbrook et al., 2016; Schmitt et al.,2022). Following reductions in herbivory, some coral reefs have transitioned to a degraded ecosystem state in which macroalgae become the dominant space holder (Hughes, 1994; Mumby et al.,2013; Vieira, 2020). Once mature, macroalgae can become phys- ically and/or chemically defended against herbivory (Davis, 2018) and compete directly with corals for reef space by overgrowing live colonies and preempting settlement space for coral larvae (McCook et al., 2001; Vieira, 2020). This suggests that macroalgae that are ini- tially protected by dead coral structures could persist on the reef well after the dead structures have completely eroded away, potentially trapping the system in the alter- native, macroalgae-dominated state. 2of15KOPECKYET AL. 19399170, 0, Downloaded from https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.4006 by University Of California, Santa Barbara, Wiley Online Library on [13/03/2023].

TYPEOriginal Research PUBLISHED07 February 2023 DOI10.3389/fmars.2023.1072807 Introduction To predict the ecological consequences of global change, we require a mechanistic understanding of how changes in temperature cascade from changes in animal physiology to changes in animal ecology. However, our mechanistic understanding of temperature-dependence in ecology remains incomplete. One way to measure the effects of temperature in ecology is to measure how the strength of interactions between two species changes as temperature changes. Here we consider temperature dependence in predator-prey interactions and define interaction strength as the the effect of one individual of a predator has on one individual of a prey species per unit time (Laska and Wootton, 1998). It is well established that increases in temperature typically increase the strength of predator- prey interactions (Rall et al., 2010;Kordas et al., 2011), which has the potential alter ecosystem dynamics and stability (Vasseur and McCann, 2005;Vucic-Pestic et al., 2011; e.g.,Gilbert et al., 2014). However we are still unpacking the physiological mechanisms underlying temperature-dependent predation (Biro and Stamps, 2010;Warne et al., 2019). Resolving this incomplete link between temperature-dependence in physiology and predation can allow us to better predict how natural and human-induced shifts in temperature are likely to alter the strength of interactions between species to shift ecosystem stability, function, and services (Chiabai et al., 2018). For ectotherms, the leading hypothesis for why predation rates increase with temperature is that rising temperatures increase an animal’s basal metabolism, and that this increase in metabolism with temperature creates a caloric demand that an animal can only meet by increasing their consumption rates (Brown et al., 2004). However, metabolism and consumption may not increase at the same rate with with temperature. If metabolism increases more rapidly with temperature than consumption increases, animals may spend the majority of the calories they consume maintaining homeostasis rather than allocating new calories to growth or egg production as temperatures rise (Vucic-Pestic et al., 2011;Rall et al., 2012;Huey and Kingsolver, 2019). Such a calorie deficit would be a mechanistic explanation for potential negative consequences of global warming on natural ecosystems (Huey and Kingsolver, 2019). Yet very few studies have simultaneously studied the effects of temperature on animal metabolism and predation rates to explicitly link metabolism to predation and resolve whether predation rates change sufficiently rapidly to meet metabolic demand at temperature extremes (Sohlström et al., 2021). Much of what ecologists know about the link between temperature, metabolism, and predation comes from tests of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE), which predicts that predation rates should increase with temperature at the same rate as basal metabolism increases with temperature (Gillooly et al., 2001;Brown et al., 2004;Clarke, 2004). Meta-analysis testing the prediction suggests that while predation rates do systematically increase with temperature, the rate at which predation increases with temperature differs substantially from the predictions of metabolic theory (Englund et al., 2011;Rall et al., 2012;Bruno et al., 2015; Lindmark et al., 2022). These tests further our understanding of scaling relationships, but do not directly correlate an animal’s metabolism with its predation rate and thus offer little insight into whether rising temperatures cause calorie deficits. Instead, they examine how predation rates scale across taxa that live in different temperatures and compare this scaling to the rate at which metabolism scales across taxa that live in different temperatures (but seeLindmark et al., 2022). To understand whether and how metabolism and predation are connected we require studies that carefully measure animal bioenergetics and link an individual predator’s metabolism to its predation rate. Ecologists thinking about temperature-dependence in predator metabolism typically focus on standard metabolic rate as a predictor of predation rates (Vucic-Pestic et al., 2011). Standard metabolic rate, which describes an organism’s baseline energy expenditure at rest excluding digestion, reproduction, and growth (Hulbert and Else, 2000), should explain some of an animal’s demand for food because animals must at minimum meet these demands to survive. In practice, resting metabolic rates are commonly measured in lieu of standard metabolic rates because of the logistical challenges of measuring animals over several days (Eliason and Farrell, 2016). However, additional components of animal metabolism are also important, because the act of predation must feed the calories required for an animal’s basal metabolism as well as the energy need to grow, reproduce, forage and digest food (predation) (Biro and Stamps, 2010). Individuals with higher standard or resting metabolic rates also tend to have higher maximum metabolic rates (Killen et al., 2016), which expands their energetic capacity that can be invested in prior listed vital performances. Therefore, measuring standard or resting metabolic rate alone may underestimate the bioenergetic demands that fuel predation intensity and behavior. Instead, we predict an animal’s absolute aerobic scope (AAS)–the difference between the maximum metabolic rate (MMR) that sets the upper limit for AAS and resting metabolic rate (RMR)–to predict predator consumption rates (e.g.,Auer et al., 2015). Absolute aerobic scope represents the overall capacity for the cardio-respiratory system to supply oxygen for activities beyond resting metabolic rate, and can be positively correlated with a variety of performance measures such as locomotion (Killen et al., 2007), feeding capacity (Auer et al., 2015), and ability to recover from exercise or stress events (Marras et al., 2010). In this study we link temperature-dependence in physiological responses to temperatur",

Here, we use a mathematical model of a predatory fish that consumes two competing coral mutualists to show that predators can also have indirect positive effects on hosts when they preferentially consume competitively dominant mutualists that are also lower in quality. In these cases, predation reverses the outcome of competition, allowing the higher quality mutualist to dominate and enhancing host performance. The direction and strength of predator effects depend on asymmetries in mutualist competition, service provision, and predation vulnerability.

Where predators have been con- sidered, the common prediction is that predators reduce mutualist abundance and, as a consequence, decrease service provision. Here, we use a mathemati- cal model of a predatory fish that consumes two competing coral mutualists to show that predators can also have indirect positive effects on hosts when they preferentially consume competitively dominant mutualists that are also lower in quality. In these cases, predation reverses the outcome of competition, allowing the higher quality mutualist to dominate and enhancing host perfor- mance. The direction and strength of predator effects depend on asymmetries in mutualist competition, service provision, and predation vulnerability. Our findings suggest that when the strength of predation shifts (e.g., due to exploit- ative harvest of top predators, introduction of new species, or range shifts in response to climate change), mutualist communities will exhibit dynamic responses with nonmonotonic effects on host service provision. KEYWORDS coral reefs, foundation species, Lotka–Volterra competition INTRODUCTION Mutualisms—reciprocally beneficial interactions between members of two or more species—hold great appeal to biol- ogists. Whether mediated by service (e.g., pollinators bearing pollen from plant to plant) or resource (e.g., the nectar reward plants offer their pollinators), they capture our imag- ination. The study of mutualisms has evolved from initial research focused on pairwise positive–positive interactions between species, to a more recent focus on multispecies guilds—suites of mutualistic partners of potentially variable quality (Bronstein, 1994;Palmeretal.,2015;Stanton,2003). Additionally, mutualism biology has expanded to consider how mutualisms are embedded within the tangled web of complex species interactions that also include other ecological processes such as competition, nutrient limitation, and predation. For example, recent empirical studies have examined how predators may control mutualist populations and thereby alter partner availability and performance (see Knight et al., 2006). However, the majority of research linking trophic interactions and mutualisms has been empiri- cal and the subject has received limited theoretical attention, restricting our general understanding of how Received: 7 September 2022Accepted: 13 September 2022 DOI: 10.1002/ecs2.4382 This is an open access article under the terms of theCreative Commons AttributionLicense, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. © 2023 The Authors.Ecospherepublished by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of The Ecological Society of America.

Virtually all mutualisms are embedded in a trophic framework. For example, the ubiquitous plant–pollinator mutualism is shaped by herbivory and insectivory (Benoit & Kalisz, 2020; Knight et al.,2006), and predators can disrupt plant dispersal when they consume frugivores (Rogers et al., 2017). In general, predation on mutualists is expected to negatively affect host performance by reducing the abundance or behavioral activity of mutualists (Knight et al., 2006). For example, predation can reduce pollinator activity levels (Romero et al., 2011) and indirectly reduce plant fitness (Romero & Koricheva, 2011). However, it is possible to imagine alternate scenarios where predators have no effect or an indirect positive effect on the host, particularly when predation on a guild of competing mutu- alists is considered. For example, if predator-mediated coexistence favors the persistence of higher quality mutu- alists, indirect benefits to the mutualistic partners should be observed. As the mutualism literature has grown, it has become increasingly clear that mutualists can vary tremendously in their level of service to the host (Brodie et al., 2009; Palmer et al., 2010), can compete or cooperate with one another to affect host performance (Johnson & Bronstein, 2019; Miller,2007; Stanton,2003), and that not all mutu- alists are equally impacted by predation (Brechbühl et al., 2010). Mathematical models can help us to predict how predators alter mutualist and host performance by integrating variable mutualist performance, competitive or cooperative interactions between mutualists, and vari- ability in mutualists’susceptibility to predation. Here, we use a mathematical model for multispecies mutualisms in a food web context that is inspired by a system of mutualistic coral-dwelling fishes that increase the growth of their coral hosts by excreting nitrogen-rich waste products into the nutrient-poor tropical waters where corals grow (Detmer et al., 2022; Holbrook et al., 2008). This increased growth of the coral in turn offers shelter for communities of coral-dwelling fish. Predation is a powerful force affecting the abundance of these coral reef fishes (Stier et al., 2017), but the effects of predators vary among the fish mutualists and can alter the outcome of competition among fish mutualists (Schmitt et al., 2009). While our model formulation is inspired by coral-dwelling fishes, our approach identifies a generaliz- able set of conditions under which higher trophic level may enhance mutualism performance. We particularly focus on the combinations of mutualist guild member quality, competitive strength, and susceptibility to preda- tion that create scenarios with unexpected benefits cas- cading from higher trophic levels to mutualist hosts. Finally, given the context of our study system in an era of defaunation (Dirzo et al., 2014), we discuss potential implications for conservation and management. THE MODEL To construct our mathematical model, we drew inspira- tion from a real biological system in which a multispecies mutualism is exposed to variable predation pressure (Figure 1). Tropical coral reefs are populated by dozens of fish species. Some of these species live on or among the interstices of branching corals where they receive protec- tion from predation (Hixon, 1991). These coral-dwelling fishes excrete nitrogen-rich waste products, typically in the form of ammonium and/or urea (Allgeier et al., 2017), which can be taken up by the coral and are trans- ferred to and used by the photosynthetic algae living inside of the coral animal’s tissue (Holbrook et al., 2008; Muscatine et al., 1989). The photosynthate produced by these algae feeds the coral, stimulating coral growth. FIGURE 1A model for the coral–fish–predator mutualism system. We model a population of coralsC(here, one coral colony is shown for illustrative convenience) which hosts two coral-dwelling fishes: damselfishDand hawkfishH. Both fish species are vulnerable to predation by a mesopredatorP, which is itself susceptible to fishing pressure. Depending upon the mutualists’traits, coral area exhibits divergent responses to increasing predator abundances.

Both hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus) and yellow-tailed damselfish (Dascyllus flavicaudus) colonize branching colonies of the coral genus Pocillopora. While hawkfish—mesopredators that occa- sionally prey on damselfish—are the dominant competi- tors (Holbrook et al., 2011), corals that host damselfish grow significantly faster than those with hawkfish (Holbrook et al., 2008). Both fishes are preyed upon by transient predatory fishes(e.g., longface emperor Lethrinus olivaceus), though predation rates in Moorea are not well known and vary significantly across sites (Schmitt & Holbrook, 2007). We represented the interaction between a population of corals (C), the associated populations of coral-dwelling damselfish (D) and hawkfish (H), and the predators of these fishes (P) using a system of four differential equa- tions.

We note that these recovery metrics are conservative indicators; change in extinc- tion risk status, in particular, represents a high bar for recovery as ‘no change’ may indicate an absence of data or outdated assessment. To evaluate drivers of recovery, we compiled information on conservation actions from the most recent IUCN assessments and compared patterns of actions employed for species with positive versus negative recovery out- comes. To do so, we compiled data for each species using the 11 IUCN-defined categories under ‘Conservation Actions In-Place’ (e.g., International Legislation) (Table S5). We then tested whether conservation actions were significantly associated with positive recovery outcomes using binomial logistic regression, where responses were positive only when status had ‘improved’ (merging ‘unchanged’ with ‘declined’ for this analysis) or when trend was ‘increasing’ (merging ‘stable’ with ‘decreasing’). We employed backwards stepwise selection to iden- tify the best performing binomial logistic regression model with respect to AIC and used the coefficients of the resulting model to infer the change in log-odds of recovery associated with each action. Because recoveries were dominated by marine mammals, we repeated the analysis with and without this taxonomic group in order to identify associations between recoveries and conservation actions that were attributable to this group alone. To complement IUCN-defined conservation actions, we created a list of 15 common conservation actions (nested in 5 broader categories; see Table S5) based on the text of the IUCN assessment “Conservation Actions In Detail.” We then tested whether conser",

Conversely, ongoing declines are robustly linked to threats that include habitat modification and human conflict. Applying lessons from cases of large carnivore recovery will be crucial for restoring intact ecosystems and maintaining the services they provide to humans. Historically, the majority of conservation research has focused on critical cases where conservation objectives remain unmet 1 . An alternative approach seeks to borrow strategies from conservation successes 2,3 , using posi- tive deviations, or ‘bright spots,’ to identify the factors influencing variation in recovery outcomes 4 . We apply this approach to large carnivores whose size and terminal position in food chains can lead to outsized ecological effects and conservation value 5 . Large carnivores, although taxonomically disparate, represent an ecologically coherent group 6 as a result of the cascading effects they can have on ecosystems, including promoting biodi- versity, altering nutrient cycling, and regulating disease 5,7 . Examining cases of large carnivore recovery and recolonization is critical for understanding the context-dependence of top-down effects 8 and how ecosystem function compares among intact and defaunated ecosystems 9 . Although rebounding large carnivore populations can introduce new tradeoffs 10 , the socio-ecological benefits of their recovery often exceeds associated costs 11 . Yet the traits common among species at high trophic levels—large range requirements, low reproductive rates, and high potential for human-wildlife conflict—make large carnivore conservation particularly challenging and increase their vulnerability, especially as the proportion of landscapes and seascapes devoid of intense human impact continues to shrink 12 . As a consequence of intense exploitation and widespread ecosystem transformation, the abundance of large carnivores globally has been dramatically reduced 13,14 . The exploitation of wildlife for human consumption rep- resents a major source of food and income, particularly in rural regions 15 ; accordingly, direct harvesting remains a primary threat to megafauna across ecosystems 16,17 . At present, 94% of freshwater megafauna are considered overexploited 18 while oceanic shark populations have declined by more than two-thirds since 1970 due primar- ily to overfishing 17 . Beyond exploitation, agricultural expansion has led to steep declines in large carnivore populations, exemplified by the spread of oil palm plantations across Sumatran tiger habitat 19 . Furthermore, a growing number of large carnivore species are affected by emerging threats, including climate change and the bioaccumulation of organic pollutants 20 , which can act synergistically when climate-mediated loss of prey exacerbates contaminant exposure 21 .

Among terrestrial predators, populations of wolves, bears, wolverines, and lynx across Europe have largely increased or remained stable in recent years despite high human population density in the region 22 . In the ocean, improved management and increasing protection of habitats have achieved notable predator recoveries 3 : the banning of gill nets and the protection of spawning aggregations have reversed declin- ing population trends in Giant sea bass (Stereolepis gigas) in the North Pacific and Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) in the Eastern Atlantic, respectively 23,24 . Examples such as these point to opportunities to scale-up and replicate successful strategies and offer a message of cautious optimism that recovery is possible—a message that is more likely to inspire action than the prevailing narrative of monolithic degradation 25 . Moreover, uncovering the conservation actions associated with these positive outliers is critical for moving toward evidence-based conservation 26,27 . Here, we present a synthesis of large carnivore recoveries, examining the variation in global recovery outcomes and illustrating these results with concrete lessons from instructive cases. Using published databases, we assembled a list of large carnivore species, drawing from all major vertebrate groups and spanning ecosystems. We used criteria synthesized from the ecological literature pertaining to body size, diet, and ecology (see “Methods”) to assemble a list of large-bodied carnivores that function as a terminal consumer in a particular ecological context. We compiled data on population trends and extinction risk status from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and examined how current extinction risk varies across the six major taxonomic groups represented: cartilaginous fishes, bony fishes, amphibians and reptiles, birds, terrestrial mammals, and marine mammals. We then assessed two temporal metrics indicative of recovery, (1) an increasing population trend, and (2) genuine improvements in IUCN extinction risk. We employed binomial logistic regression models to test associations between recoveries and conservation actions. Lastly, we examined the prevalence of anthropogenic threats affecting our species pool and tested their relationship with ongoing large carnivore declines. Patterns of extinction risk. We identified 362 vertebrate species distributed across all major ecosystem types (Fig. S1) that met our criteria and to which the IUCN has assigned a known extinction risk category. Over- all, 38% [35%–43%] of large carnivore species are considered threatened (encompassing ‘Vulnerable’, ‘Endan- gered’, or ‘Critically Endangered’ species; lower and upper bounds reflect the uncertainty introduced by Data Deficient species). This represents a substantially higher proportion of threatened species compared to Red List averages of 27% for all species and 18% for all vertebrates. Among these species, extinction risk is unevenly dis- tributed across geographic regions. Large carnivore species in the Nearctic and Australasia regions show a lower proportion of threatened species (13%, and 27% threatened, respectively); compared with the Afrotropic (39%) and Indo-Malay regions (41%). We note that developed regions with lower proportions of threatened species have previously lost sensitive megafauna to Pleistocene extinctions 28 , export a sizeable share of their environ- mental impacts 29 , and show lower rates of increase of human population compared with developing regions 30 . Extinction risk also varied widely among vertebrate groups (Fig. 1). Marine mammals show the lowest pro- portion of threatened species (27% threatened [20%–44%]) offering a stark contrast with the high extinction risk among sharks and rays (61% threatened [55%–65%]). Indeed, while more than half of all large carnivore species are categorized Least Concern, only 17% of shark species occupy this lowest extinction risk category (Fig. 2; Table S1). The wide disparity in status for these two groups of marine megafauna corroborates evidence that while the cessation of industrial exploitation of marine mammals has initiated successful recoveries within this group 31 , many shark species remain intensely and unsustainably exploited 17,32 . As these groups of marine megafauna show little functional redundancy 33 , ongoing declines among sharks are likely to have deleterious ecological effects, including mesopredator release and altered carbon dynamics 34 . Among the remaining taxa, fully half of terrestrial mammals are listed as threatened, nearly double the rate of all IUCN mammal species. Further, roughly one-third of reptiles, birds, and bony fishes are threatened, compared with taxon-wide rates of 34%, 14%, 6% respectively. Large carnivore recoveries. On its ow",

One critical threshold is the biomass at which populations become so depleted that their population growth rates become negative—depensation. Here, we evaluate how the value of moni- toring information increases as a natural resource spends more time near the critical threshold. This benefit emerges because higher monitoring precision promotes higher yield and a greater capacity to recover from overharvest. We show that precautionary buffers that trigger increased monitoring precision as resource levels decline may offer a way to minimize monitoring costs and maximize profits. In a world of finite resources, improving our understanding of the trade-off between precision in estimates of population status and the costs of mismanagement will benefit stakeholders that shoulder the burden of these economic and social costs. 1. Introduction Decision-makers seeking to avoid the collapse of financial, public health or military defence systems often rely on detailed information to manage risk. However, high-precision monitoring of these systems is often costly, requires analysis and storage of large datasets and can delay decision making. In natural resource management, a major question is how much monitoring is needed to maximize the delivery of ecosystem benefits to people while minimizing the risk of species or ecosystem collapse [1–3]? The status of a species or ecosystem is determined from monitoring or survey data, and assessed relative to one or more minimum thresholds, below which the risk of species or socio-economic collapse surpasses the risk tolerance of manage- ment. For example, in the management of a single natural resource like a fishery, management strategies often include lower population limits below which harvest is suspended (i.e. a‘limit reference point’). Thresholds are accounted for in man- agement strategies in the form of decision triggers [4] and in the form of reference points designed to minimize the risk of falling below a productivity threshold [5]. This management threshold is set, in part, because managers © 2022 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved. Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 16 June 2022 recognize that when systems fall below thisthreshold there is an elevated risk of serious or irreversible harm to populations, eco- systems, economies and societies. Typically, a management threshold is designed to allow sustainable harvest, but also to minimize the chances that a population will cross a biological threshold, below which irreversible harm can occur to a popu- lation [6]. When populations are overharvested, they can experience phenomena such as inbreeding depression, predator pits or mate limitation [7], which at critically low densities can lead to population extinction (i.e. an extinction vortex [8]). The consequences of crossing certain thresholds, such as depensa- tory thresholds, are even greater since depensation can cause irreversible population collapse. The crossing of other thresholds, such as those defined by limit reference points, is often reversible but can also have devastating social and econ- omic consequences [9], particularly when crossing them triggers cessation of harvest or reduced access. High-precision monitoring can lower the risk of crossing critical thresholds and ensure the delivery of services, but can also be very expensive [2,3]. Even with consistent and intensive monitoring, managers may never have perfect knowledge of how close a population is to crossing a critical threshold, or whether such a threshold exists. For example, Allee effects have long been suspected to occur in fish popu- lations and evidence suggests that they may be the cause of some population collapses, but evidence for these effects can be hard to come by [10,11].‘Emergent’Allee effects can result from increases in predator abundance even if prey popu- lations remain constant [12]. Even in a case where a threshold is known to exist two factors would prevent managers from knowing how close a stock is to such a threshold. First, shifts in the external drivers that affect natural populations (e.g. the environment) are not always predictable, which means that assessments may not detect the location of a threshold before it is crossed [13]. Second, in any survey, there is measurement error, which even in well-studied popu- lations can be high. Both of these sources of uncertainty mean that an assessment might incorrectly categorize a population as being a‘safe’distance from a threshold, when in reality the population is at or past a threshold beyond which it will take decades to recover. Limited monitoring resources and an incomplete understanding of ecosystems can restrict efforts to devise monitoring strategies that—without crossing a threshold—both maximize ecosystem services and balance risk of harvesting across multiple stakeholders. Previous studies have emphasized that intensive monitor- ing is not always beneficial, particularly when such efforts incur high costs that outweigh the management or conserva- tion benefits [3], such as monitoring extremely rare or cryptic threatened species [14], or monitoring a proportion of the population that does not provide a precise index of abun- dance. Here, we extend these studies by focusing on the value of monitoring information for harvested populations with critical biological thresholds. Our expectation is that the value of monitoring depends not only on how far a popu- lation is from the threshold, but also on population state, whereby a population that spends more time close to a criti- cal threshold benefits more from precise monitoring than one that spends time far from it, and that precise monitoring will promote the resilience of degraded populations when they are overexploited. However, these simple expectations may not be fully borne out in a dynamic system. Thus, we seek to explore when and where our expectation holds, and what elements of a natural resource system strengthen the benefit of state-dependent monitoring. We do this by asking four questions: (i) How do monitoring precision and harvest rate affect the risk of population collapse and the value of the resource? (ii) Does the value of monitoring increase with higher proximity to a critical threshold? (iii) Can monitoring allow harvested populations to recover from dangerously low levels? (iv) How can managers balance the costs and benefits of monitoring populations prone to collapse? 2. Methods (a) Closed-loop management strategy evaluation overview We used a closed-loop management strategy evaluation, a tool that evaluates the likely consequence of applying a harvest strategy, given uncertainty in a system’s dynamics [15]. The simulation proceeded in four steps. First, we simulated the biological dynamics of a system. Second, we simulated a moni- toring process, where the total biomass of the resource was surveyed with some error. Third, we used an assessment model to simulate the estimation of system biomass based on data from the survey. Fourth, a management model determined the level of resource harvest given the estimated biomass. The harvest was taken out of the true population size each year. The entire process was repeated for a 50-year simulation with 10 000 replicate iterations.

TYPEOriginal Research PUBLISHED21 September 2022 DOI10.3389/fmars.2022.945204 Introduction In the face of global change, ecosystem resilience is necessary to maintain the critical services ocean ecosystems provide, yet we still know relatively little about how many anthropogenic pressure an ecosystem can takebeforeitisirrevocably changed. In some circumstances, the accumulation of human impacts has induced ecosystem reorganizations called“regime shifts”,defined as abrupt changes in the structure and function of ecosystems (Scheffer et al., 2001;Beisner et al., 2003;Scheffer and Carpenter, 2003;Möllmann et al., 2015;Rocha et al., 2015). When regime shifts occur, previously abundant commercially- harvested species can be replaced by more tolerant species that areabletothriveunderthenewmoreheavilyimpacted conditions (Beaugrand, 2004;Vasilakopoulos et al., 2017). These changes can be socially and economically costly when they require adaptation by ocean users, including significant modifications to harvest methods, supply chains, and infrastructure (Carpenter, 2001;Scheffer et al., 2001;Levin and Möllmann, 2015). As a result, avoiding regime shifts, or reversing them, is often preferred. However, reversals can be slow and are not always possible, because of hysteresis–the delayed return to previous conditions following a regime. Therefore, there is continued interest and value in understanding what drives regime shifts, and there is significant uncertainty whether regime shifts can be reversed, and what management solutions exist in case of irreversibility (Levin and Möllmann, 2015;Selkoe et al., 2015). While it is evident that avoiding irreversible regime shifts in a social-ecological system is fundamental in order to maintain services, the management application is not straightforward. The consideration of abrupt non-linear change in management is often undermined by the lack of consensus on the definition of the word“regime shift”and by methodological limitations. The former derives from the use of the same word“regime shift”in completely opposite contexts. Indeed, regime shift is used sometimes to describe a simple“phase shift”not characterized by hysteresis and sometimes to describe alternative stable states characterized by hysteresis (Scheffer et al., 2001;Selkoe et al., 2015). This lack of an agreed definition creates confusion in the scientific community around the concept and a certain level of disbelief in its importance. The presence of multiple de finitions with opposite dynamics (with or without hysteresis) has repercussion also on their detection. Simple statistical change point analyses can be useful to identify phase shifts without hysteresis, but are not enough to detect the presence of irreversible regime shifts (Andersen et al., 2009). However, the majority of the paper studying regime shifts employs these types of methods and do not quantify or detect hysteresis. Moreover, often the drivers of regime shifts are not statistically tested. Identifying the drivers of regime shifts can be relatively straightforward using empirical data. In general, human impacts such asfishing pressure and environmental drivers like temperature can be regressed against different types of ecosystem metrics to determine which combination of drivers caused observed shifts (Beaugrand, 2004;Andersen et al., 2009). Understanding whether a regime shift is reversible or irreversible, thus quantifying hysteresis, is however far more challenging and has rarely been done using empirical data both due to the shortness of the time series but also due to the difficulty offinding suitable statistical methods (Vasilakopoulos et al., 2017;Sguotti and Cormon, 2018;Schmitt et al., 2019). Hysteresis and irreversibility are due to powerful feedbacks loops (Beisner et al., 2003). These feedbacks stabilize the new regime through the creation of new interactions among species, new energy pathways and new system structures making it difficult or impossible to transit back to the previous system state even if the original driver of the regime shift is removed or alleviated. Thus, to determine whether a regime shift is reversible or not we need to answer two main questions. 1) How strong is the hysteresis? In other words, how much do we need to alter the drivers in order to disrupt the feedback loops formed in the new system? 2) Is management able to revert the drivers? Some drivers such asfishing or pollution can be reduced, while other pressure such as global climate change are likely more difficult to reverse (Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010). Here, we study regime shifts in the North Sea large marine ecosystem which is experiencing rapid warming and also intensive fishing pressure and is one of the most heavily human impacted areas in the world (Emeis et al., 2015). Firstly, we conducted a literature review to check what regime shifts have been documented and which methods were used to detect them. Previous analyses have documented regime shifts (abrupt ecosystem changes) in the North Sea in subsets of the ecosystem such as plankton orfishes in the 1980s and 1990s (Beaugrand, 2004;DeYoung et al., 2008;Wouters et al., 2015), however using models not able to quantify hysteresis. Afterwards, we collected data on the North Sea ecosystem to conduct a comprehensive analysis of its regime shifts, using all trophic levels of the ecosystem. We used the stochastic cusp model, an approach derived from catastrophe theory in order to detect a regime shift over the last 40 years in the ecosystem and test whether it was reversible or irreversible. We show the interactive effects of global warming and changes infishing pressure in driving the most recent regime and document the existence of hysteresis (i.e. irreversibility). If reduced,fishing pressure could help to increase the yield of the currently exploited species; however, simply removingfi shing pressure is unlikely to reverse the regime shift, which is maintained by other feedbacks. Moreover, since climate change is not currently reversible and can only be mitigated, we suggest that the new regime in which the North Sea resides now is irreversible and thus major adaptations need to be undertaken in order to maximize the services that can be provided by this newly transformed ecosystem.

KEYWORDS consumption, density dependence, detritus, ecosystem transition, herbivore, kelp INTRODUCTION Intense foraging by primary consumers can fundamen- tally alter the structure and function of communities (Silliman et al., 2013). For instance, outbreaks of herbivo- rous insects can defoliate forests across thousands of square kilometers (Kautz et al., 2016), grazing by ungu- lates can denude landscapes (Hopcraft et al., 2010), and predation by sea stars can lead to widespread mortality of reef building corals (Holbrook et al., 2018). In extreme cases, consumers can eliminate the dominant primary Mae Rennick and Bartholomew P. DiFiore contributed equally to this manuscript. Received: 22 March 2021Revised: 29 September 2021Accepted: 15 October 2021 DOI: 10.1002/ecy.3673 Ecology.2022;e3673.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/r/ecy© 2022 The Ecological Society of America.1 of 12 https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3673 producers in a community, reducing productivity and leaving only producers that are resistant to foraging (Augustine & McNaughton, 1998). Consumer-driven changes in community structure are often persistent, such that even when consumer abundance decreases, the community remains in an alternative state (Schröder et al., 2005). Yet, high consumer density does not always trigger alternative ecosystem states. Some locations can support high biomass of consumers, while others undergo rapid shifts at relatively low consumer biomass. The mechanism underlying variability in when and where consumers drive shifts into alternative community states remains an active area of research. Resolving this context dependency is critical to understanding ecosys- tem tipping points and to avoid crossing biological thresholds to alternative states that provide fewer services to people and nature. In principle, consumer-driven shifts to alternative states occur when consumption exceeds resource produc- tion. Predicting when and where consumption exceeds production requires an understanding of how consumer foraging behavior and per-capita consumption rates shift with consumer density. The relationship between con- sumer density and per-capita consumption can take three plausible forms (Klemmer et al., 2012). First, increases in consumer density can have no effect on per-capita con- sumption, such that the collective consumption rate of a population increases linearly with consumer density (Reice, 1991). Second, interference or competition among consumers as consumer density increases can cause per- capita consumption to decline. At the population-scale, competition can cause consumption to increase at a decel- erating rate with density, because competition is weaker at low densities and stronger at high densities (Arditi & Ginzburg, 1989; Brook & Bradshaw, 2006; Little et al., 2020). Finally, facilitation among consumers can cause per- capita consumption to increase as consumer density increases. In this case, the collective consumption rate of a group might accelerate exponentially or sigmoidally with consumer density (McKie et al., 2009; Sommer, 1992). When the relationship between consumer density and per- capita consumption is constant or positive, there is a higher probability that increases in consumer density will cause large reductions in primary producers because consumers are not limited by intraspecific competition. However, the extent to which constant or positive increases in foraging with consumer density are common in consumer-driven disturbances remains unclear, particularly in ecosystems that are prone to alternative states. Here, we quantify how the relationship between con- sumer biomass and consumer foraging rates drives when and where kelp forest ecosystems undergo shifts to alter- native states. Temperate rocky reefs characterized by kelp, a group of canopy-forming brown macroalgae that form productive subtidal“forests,”are known to experi- ence abrupt changes from kelp-dominated communities to communities with little to no kelp (Filbee-Dexter & Scheibling, 2014; Ling et al., 2015). An important factor causing such state shifts is intensive grazing by sea urchins, which has been linked to massive declines in kelp abundance and the formation of urchin-dominated states, known as urchin barrens, that can persist for decades (Lawrence, 1975; Sala et al., 1998; Spindel et al., 2021). Urchin barrens occur on shallow rocky reefs worldwide and are characterized by herbivore-resistant algal species (Ling & Johnson, 2009) that display lower net primary productivity and biodiversity than kelp- dominated sites (Steneck et al., 2002). In theory, kelp deforestation should result when the consumption rate of an urchin population exceeds kelp production. Increases in the consumption rate can occur due to increases in urchin density, such as when top-down con- trol by urchin predators is reduced or urchin recruitment to a site is high. Alternatively, kelp production can vary independently of urchins due to temperature (Wernberg et al., 2016), wave disturbance (Dayton & Tegner, 1984; Reed et al., 2011), and nutrient availability (Bell et al., 2015). Across temperate rocky reefs, kelp abundance can be high even when urchin abundance is high and changes in urchin abundance do not result in propor- tional declines in kelp (Ling et al., 2015), suggesting that when and where urchins deforest kelp communities depends on the balance between kelp production and how much kelp urchins consume at a given urchin biomass. One long-standing hypothesis for why urchin populations switch from coexisting with kelp to deforesting kelp is a shift in foraging behavior (Harrold & Reed, 1985). Urchins are notably omnivorous, foraging on kelp, pieces of kelp detached from the substrate (e.g., detritus), other algal species, invertebrates (e.g., salps or tubeworms, Duggins, 1981; Spindel et al., 2021), or calcareous reef struc- tures (Rasher et al., 2020). The leading hypothesis is that urchins passively forage on kelp detritus until a change in kelp production causes urchins to actively graze canopy- forming kelps attached to the substrate (from this point for- wards“standing”kelp,sensuKriegisch et al., 2019). How- ever, variation in urchin foraging rates with changes in urchin biomass could interact with shifts in the availability of detritus to result in kelp deforestation. For instance, if urchin foraging rates are invariant with urchin biomass and urchin biomass is high, then slight declines in detrital production in a kelp community could cause urchins to actively graze standing kelp. Yet, if urchins increase their per-capita feeding rates through facilitation—as may occur in grazing fronts (Dean et al., 1984; Ling et al., 2019)—then 2 of 12RENNICKET AL. small changes in urchin biomass at a threshold might result in deforestation without a change in detrital production. In this study, we tested how the relationship between density-dependent foraging rates and primary production alters a community’s resistance to consumer-driven changes in community state using California rocky reefs dominated byMacrocystis pyrifera(from this point for- wards,“kelp”) as a model system. We first investigated how the foraging rate of urchins varied with urchin bio- mass using mesocosm foraging experiments. We coupled these experimental results with 21 years of spatially explicit data on kelp community dynamics to hindcast rates of detrital production and consumption. Finally, we tested the long-standing hypothesis that production of kelp detritus suppresses deforestation by quantifying how the relationship between detrital supply and predicted urchin consumption alters the",

Ecosphere.2022;13:e4110. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/r/ecs21of16 https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4110 INTRODUCTION Marine reserves are no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) that are widely recognized as effective conserva- tion tools for protecting marine resources within their borders (Byers, 2005; Di Franco et al.,2016; Lubchenco et al., 2003; Sala & Giakoumi,2017). Establishing and enforcing marine reserves often lead to the increased size, density, and spawning biomass of harvested species. Theory predicts that marine reserves can increase the reliability of exploitable fish stocks for the benefit of fishers (Lester et al., 2009; Roberts et al.,2005; Russ & Alcala, 2011). One mechanism by which reserves can benefit fisheries is through“spillover,”of which there are two main forms. First, protection from fishing can lead to an increase in the abundance and biomass of reproductive adults that produce relatively many eggs or larvae that disperse from within reserve borders to areas outside of reserves, where animals can be harvested (e.g., Botsford et al., 2009; Gell & Roberts,2003; Pelc et al., 2010). Jennings (2000) described this mechanism as increases in spawner biomass per recruit and larval supply by protecting“source”populations. Second, an increase in the population density, and individual size of animals within a reserve, can stimulate juvenile and adult individuals to migrate from inside to outside of reserve borders in search of food, habitat, or mates, or to avoid aggressive interactions with conspecifics (e.g., Di Lorenzo et al., 2016,2020; Halpern et al.,2010; Kellner et al., 2007). Both mechanisms of spillover can enhance fisheries by increasing the overall biomass of target spe- cies available for harvest in open fishing grounds. How- ever, the capacity for marine reserves to benefit adjacent fisheries through spillover is controversial and an active area of research (Hilborn et al., 2004; Parrish,1999; Woodcock et al., 2017). This controversy arises, in part, from the clear short-term costs to fishers associated with reserve implementation, which typically includes the reduction in the size of available fishing grounds (Di Lorenzo et al., 2016; McClanahan,1999). In addition, the spillover of juveniles and adults is thought to enhance only fisheries in which intensive fishing has substantially depleted the stock to such a degree that the addition of individuals through spillover has a detectable positive effect on catch (Halpern et al., 2010; Walters et al.,2007; but see Lenihan et al., 2021). While theory and some empirical evidence suggest that reserves can benefit adjacent fisheries through spill- over, despite the closure of fishable habitat (Follesa et al., 2011; Goñi et al.,2010; Kerwath et al.,2013; Lenihan et al., 2021), other studies have failed to identify clear evidence of spillover benefits (Willis et al., 2003). Evaluation of what underlies the long-term benefits of marine reserves as fishery management tools requires ongoing site-specific empirical study (Caselle et al., 2015; De Leo & Micheli, 2015; Kay, Lenihan, Guenther, et al., 2012; Sale et al.,2005). Whether and to what extent reserves provide net economic benefits to a fishery through spillover depends on a suite of biological, social, and economic factors that usually take time to develop (Lynham et al., 2020). Even after protection occurs and mortality from harvest goes down inside reserves, it usu- ally takes time for most species to build up in biomass inside a protected area (Kaplan et al., 2019). Additionally, when reserves restrict access to certain fishing grounds, it may take time for fishers to adapt and find new places to fish (Guenther et al., 2015). One way to better understand the fisheries conse- quences of reserve implementation is to examine how reserves affect both the harvested species and catch through time (Lenihan et al., 2021). Specifically, we can quantify temporal changes in the biomass, size structure, and density of harvested species inside of reserves, and then relate the patterns we observe to the catch per unit effort of the harvested species (CPUE) measured outside of reserves (Goñi et al., 2011). Here, we use multiple esti- mates of catch per unit effort and biomass to examine the response of CA spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) populations to reserve protection in southern CA, and to test whether increases in lobster abundance and size inside reserves have led to greater catch through spillover in nearby fishing grounds. Lobster species have been the focus of relatively many studies designed to assess the ecological performance of marine reserves (Babcock et al., 1999; Bevacqua et al., 2010; Edgar & Barrett,1999; Goñi et al.,2006; Shears et al., 2006) and the effects of reserves on fisheries (e.g., Follesa et al., 2011; Goñi et al.,2010,2011; Ley- Cooper et al., 2014; Moland et al.,2013). Lobsters are rel- atively long-lived (30–100 years) and highly fecund (mil- lions of eggs) marine benthic predators whose larvae can spend long periods of time (6–12 months) in a planktotrophic dispersive state. Much attention has been paid to lobsters because many species are relatively very heavily fished due to their high value, and many of their biological characteristics, especially a benthic life history as juveniles and adults, and a relatively limited range of movement ( 1–2 km) as adults, mean that even rela- tively small reserves are effective tools for conservation (Kramer & Chapman, 1999; Le Quesne & Codling,2008; Moffitt et al., 2009; Moland et al.,2011). Nevertheless, the results of studies designed to quantify the spillover of rel- atively many lobster species have varied widely. Some studies detected spillover and associated fishery benefits (Bevacqua et al., 2010; Follesa et al.,2011; Goñi et al., 2006,2010; Kerwath et al.,2013; Lenihan 2of16LENIHANET AL. et al.,2021; Ley-Cooper et al.,2014; Moland et al.,2013), while others found no evidence of the spillover of legal- sized individuals (Hoskin et al., 2011; Rowe,2002)or found spillover only for relatively very larger lobsters (Thorbjørnsen et al., 2018).

Introduction Coral reefs are among the most productive and biodiverse ecosystems on the planet (Crossland et al., 1991; Fisher et al., 2015). This diversity is largely supported by the physical structure of the reefs themselves, which is primarily composed of the cal- cium carbonate skeletons of scleractinian corals (Graham and Nash, 2013; Spalding et al., 2001). Coral reefs generally occur in nutrient-poor waters, yet corals are able to calcify at a rate that supports net reef accretion due to a symbiosis with endosymbiotic algae in the family Symbiodiniaceae (Muscatine and Porter, 1977). In this partnership, the coral provides its algae with nutrients and carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis, and the algae provide fixed carbon that fuels coral growth (Davy et al., 2012). The functioning of the coral-algal symbiosis is critical for the persistence of coral reef ecosystems. However, thermal and other stressors can cause this relationship to break down, leading to the mass expulsion of symbionts known as coral bleaching (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). Severe bleaching events can result in coral mortality, and they are currently the primary threat to coral reefs worldwide (Hughes et al., 2018; Eakin et al., 2019). Bleaching commonly occurs when elevated temperatures lead to photo- oxidative stress in the symbionts, triggering their expulsion by the host coral. However, many factors influence whether and to what degree an individual coral bleaches during a stress event, including symbiont type, nutrient availability, level of hetero- trophic feeding, host morphology, and history of stress exposure (Rowan, 2004; Morris et al., 2019; Grottoli et al., 2006; Loya et al., 2001; Hackerott et al., 2021). As stress events like marine heatwaves increase in frequency and severity (Hughes et al., 2018), there is a critical need to better understand what makes https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2022.111087 0022-5193/Ó2022 The Authors.

However, in many cases, this is challenging because the factors that modulate bleach- ing susceptibility do so in complex ways. For example, although high ambient concentrations of nutrients have been shown to exacerbate bleaching (Thurber et al., 2014; Donovan et al., 2020), the effects of nutrient enrichment on bleaching depend on numer- ous factors (e.g., the form of nitrogen, N:P ratios) in ways that are not fully understood (Morris et al., 2019; Wiedenmann et al., 2013). Additionally, coral growth has been shown to exhibit a uni- modal response to nutrient enrichment (Gil, 2013), which could potentially extend to similarly non-linear effects of nutrients on bleaching. Corals’ tolerance of bleaching-inducing stressors may also be influenced by other organisms. In addition to algal endosymbionts, a diverse assortment of taxa may live on or within coral colonies (Gates and Ainsworth, 2011). In particular, the structural complex- ity created by branching corals in the generaPocilloporaandAcro- poraserves as an important habitat for many species of fishes and invertebrates (Coker et al., 2014; Stella et al., 2010). Host corals receive a range of benefits from these inhabitants, including enhanced defense against corallivores, removal of sediments, and provision of nutrients (McKeon et al., 2012; Stewart et al., 2006; Liberman et al., 1995). The presence of coral-associated fauna may also ameliorate the effects of stressors like disease and ele- vated temperatures (Pollock et al., 2013; Chase et al., 2018), sug- gesting that these mutualistic relationships could significantly influence the bleaching susceptibility of the corals that form them (Gates and Ainsworth, 2011). Coral-dwelling fishes, particularly damselfish (Family Pomacen- tridae), are widespread and abundant on many coral reefs (Coker et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2008). How these fish impact their host colonies during periods of stress could therefore have large impli- cations for the resilience of branching coral populations. However, little is known about how fish presence influences coral bleaching, or by what mechanisms. One recent study found that resident fish reduced the severity of experimentally-induced bleaching, and the authors suggested these results could be due to increased nutrient availability and/or aeration of interstitial space in the presence of fish (Chase et al., 2018). Here, we explored this hypothesis more formally and expanded on it by also asking how fish effects are mediated by environmental conditions, including ambient nitro- gen levels. We focused on the effects of fish excretions (e.g., nitrogenous wastes;Meyer and Schultz, 1985), as nutrient avail- ability can have a major influence on corals’ susceptibility to bleaching (Morris et al., 2019). In general, fishes and other con- sumers play important roles in nutrient dynamics on coral reefs, including the transport of nutrients from the water column to the benthos (Allgeier et al., 2016; Pinnegar and Polunin, 2006). Coral-dwelling fishes may have particularly large impacts on the availability of nutrients for individual coral colonies, as they are often site-attached (Booth, 2016) and inhabit colony interstices, where nutrient levels may differ from those of the surrounding water column due to colony uptake rates and flow patterns (Chamberlain and Graus, 1975). While the nutrients excreted by coral-dwelling fish have been shown to increase the growth rates of their host corals under ambient conditions (Holbrook et al., 2008), our goal with this study was to investigate how these excre- tions then modulate the host’s response to stressors capable of triggering bleaching. A mechanistic understanding of the effects of fish-derived nitro- gen on host corals requires explicit consideration of the bioener- getics of the coral-algal symbiosis. Dynamic energy budget (DEB) models, which essentially model an organism’s physiology by tracking the fluxes of elements within it (Kooijman, 2009), provide a theoretical framework to explore the effects of fish excretions. Here, we modified a DEB-based model of the coral-algal symbiosis (Cunning et al., 2017) to include nutrient excretion by coral- dwelling fish. Our goal was to investigate how fish excretions may affect host corals during periods of low and elevated stress, as well as the environmental factors that mediate these effects. We first used the model to explore how fish affected nitrogen availability and host growth under various ambient (low stress) environmental conditions. We then simulated acute stress events to investigate the sensitivity of host bleaching to nitrogen avail- ability and the underlying mechanisms. Finally, we looked at effects of fish excretion on host bleaching thresholds and post- bleaching recovery dynamics a",

One critical threshold is the biomass at which populations become so depleted that their population growth rates become negative—depensation. Here, we evaluate how the value of monitoring information increases as a natural resource spends more time near the critical threshold. This benefit emerges because higher monitoring precision promotes higher yield and a greater capacity to recover from overharvest. We show that precautionary buffers that trigger increased monitoring precision as resource levels decline may offer a way to minimize monitoring costs and maximize profits. In a world of finite resources, improving our understanding of the trade-off between precision in estimates of population status and the costs of mismanagement will benefit stakeholders that shoulder the burden of these economic and social costs.",

KEYWORDS land-sea, ecosystem structure, ecosystem function, biodiversity, urban gradient, Pacific salmon 1 Introduction Despite comprising ~2% of the global land surface, urban areas are home to more than half of the world’shuman population (United Nations (UN), 2014). In the US, 30-50% of people live in coastal counties, primarily in cities (Crossett et al., 2013). Coastal cities concentrate many social benefits for people because they serve as cultural hubs and centers of commerceandtrade(Ernstson et al., 2010), and there is increasing appreciation that they are also places that nature’s benefits are most needed (Granek et al., 2010;Lepczyk et al., 2017;Keeler et al., 2019). However, urban expansion draws down natural resources, consumes undeveloped and agricultural lands, and influences biodiversity and ecosystem functions (Bulleri and Chapman, 2010;Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD), 2012;Todd et al., 2019). While it is well understood that coastal development changes ecosystems, a quantitative understanding of the relationship between landscape-scale development, ecosystem structure, and ecosystem function relative to other local, regional, and global influences is generally lacking (Halpern et al., 2009;Ãlvarez- Romero et al., 2011; but seeMcClelland et al., 1997;Koch et al., 2009). The literature is replete with hypotheses about processes associated with urban land development that modify ecosystem structure and function (Table 1). These processes include increases in species introductions, nutrient inputs, stream flashiness, sediment runoff, water temperature, low-oxygen areas, toxic contaminants, and extractive use. Such changes can interact to affect other ecosystem properties, such as when eutrophication creates low-oxygen zones that reduce biodiversity (Stramma et al., 2010). It is common to examine impacts of urbanization on biodiversity using indicator taxa, and invertebrate communities are frequently used for such assessments because they are tractable for monitoring purposes and sensitive to environmental changes in predictable ways (Alberti et al., 2007;Clark et al., 2015). Ecologists evaluate a range of important ecosystem functions, including but not limited to primary and secondary production, transformation of organic matter (e.g., via decomposition), and nutrient cycling (Strong et al., 2015). A key factor in deciding which metrics of biodiversity and ecosystem function to monitor and track is to link them to outcomes of interest, including those associated with conservation or restoration actions. Often hypotheses about changes in ecosystem structure and function imply that the effects of development should be strongest on land, and attenuate but not necessarily extinguish in coastal marine ecosystems (Beger et al., 2010;Ãlvarez-Romero et al., 2011 ;Buckner et al., 2018). The rationale for this predicted attenuation is that many of the landscape-scale impacts occur directly in terrestrial habitats (e.g., conversion of natural to impervious surfaces) and that the indirect effects in adjacent freshwater and downstream coastal marine habitats should be comparatively diminished. In some cases, it is clear that the influence of terrestrial inputs, such as dissolved organic carbon, are diminished in freshwater and coastal marine systems, but suchfindings remain a contentious area of investigation (Brett et al., 2009). Quantitative evidence for specific urban impacts on ecosystem structure and function, such as biotic homogenization and loss of foundation species, is beginning to emerge (Cuffney et al., 2010;Kelly et al., 2016;Lee et al., 2018;Todd et al., 2019; Momota and Hosokawa, 2021). However, few published studies consider the extent to which urbanization effects are linked across land-sea boundaries, despite (a) the potential for direct changes to terrestrial and freshwater habitats to have more marginal impacts within coastal marine habitats, and (b) the Samhouri et al.10.3389/fmars.2022.931319 Frontiers inMarine Sciencefrontiersin.org02 clear importance of resolving these connectivity issues for ecosystem management (Stoms et al., 2005;Alberti et al., 2007; Tallis et al., 2008;Beger et al., 2010;Buckner et al., 2018). Species that move between freshwater and coastal marine habitats may be especially sensitive to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function caused by urbanization, as they can experience compounding effects across habitats (Gosselin et al., 2018;Friedman et al., 2019). One prominent example comes from Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchusspp.), anadromous species that coexist with humans in heavily populated urban regions as well as in remote and unpopulated areas.

Such changes can interact to affect other ecosystem properties, such as when eutrophication creates low-oxygen zones that reduce biodiversity (Stramma et al., 2010). It is common to examine impacts of urbanization on biodiversity using indicator taxa, and invertebrate communities are frequently used for such assessments because they are tractable for monitoring purposes and sensitive to environmental changes in predictable ways (Alberti et al., 2007;Clark et al., 2015). Ecologists evaluate a range of important ecosystem functions, including but not limited to primary and secondary production, transformation of organic matter (e.g., via decomposition), and nutrient cycling (Strong et al., 2015). A key factor in deciding which metrics of biodiversity and ecosystem function to monitor and track is to link them to outcomes of interest, including those associated with conservation or restoration actions. Often hypotheses about changes in ecosystem structure and function imply that the effects of development should be strongest on land, and attenuate but not necessarily extinguish in coastal marine ecosystems (Beger et al., 2010;Ãlvarez-Romero et al., 2011 ;Buckner et al., 2018). The rationale for this predicted attenuation is that many of the landscape-scale impacts occur directly in terrestrial habitats (e.g., conversion of natural to impervious surfaces) and that the indirect effects in adjacent freshwater and downstream coastal marine habitats should be comparatively diminished. In some cases, it is clear that the influence of terrestrial inputs, such as dissolved organic carbon, are diminished in freshwater and coastal marine systems, but suchfindings remain a contentious area of investigation (Brett et al., 2009). Quantitative evidence for specific urban impacts on ecosystem structure and function, such as biotic homogenization and loss of foundation species, is beginning to emerge (Cuffney et al., 2010;Kelly et al., 2016;Lee et al., 2018;Todd et al., 2019; Momota and Hosokawa, 2021). However, few published studies consider the extent to which urbanization effects are linked across land-sea boundaries, despite (a) the potential for direct changes to terrestrial and freshwater habitats to have more marginal impacts within coastal marine habitats, and (b) the Samhouri et al.10.3389/fmars.2022.931319 Frontiers inMarine Sciencefrontiersin.org02 clear importance of resolving these connectivity issues for ecosystem management (Stoms et al., 2005;Alberti et al., 2007; Tallis et al., 2008;Beger et al., 2010;Buckner et al., 2018). Species that move between freshwater and coastal marine habitats may be especially sensitive to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function caused by urbanization, as they can experience compounding effects across habitats (Gosselin et al., 2018;Friedman et al., 2019). One prominent example comes from Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchusspp.), anadromous species that coexist with humans in heavily populated urban regions as well as in remote and unpopulated areas. Urbanization has been shown to incre",

Reed 3 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are designed to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services. Some MPAs are also established to benefit fisheries through increased egg and larval production, or the spillover of mobile juveniles and adults. Whether spillover influences fishery landings depend on the population status and movement patterns of target species both inside and outside of MPAs, as well as the status of the fishery and behavior of the fleet. We tested whether an increase in the lobster population inside two newly established MPAs influenced local catch, fishing effort, and catch-per- unit-effort (CPUE) within the sustainable California spiny lobster fishery. We found greater build-up of lobsters within MPAs relative to unprotected areas, and greater increases in fishing effort and total lobster catch, but not CPUE, in fishing zones containing MPAs vs. those without MPAs. Our results show that a 35% reduction in fishing area resulting from MPA designation was compensated for by a 225% increase in total catch after 6-years, thus indicating at a local scale that the trade-off of fishing ground for no-fishing zones benefitted the fishery. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are widely recognized as effective conservation tools for protecting marine resources within their borders 1,2 , and are used with increasing frequency in marine spatial management 3 . Research has shown repeatedly that the absence of fishing in MPAs leads to increased biomass, size, density, and diversity of protected species within well-enforced reserves 4–6 . Whether positive conservation outcomes also benefit fisheries are less certain, yet are important to assess because many MPAs are established with assur- ances to local fisheries that the capacity of MPAs to increase fish stocks and yield will outweigh costs associated with the loss of fishing grounds 7–9 . MPAs are thought to enhance adjacent fisheries mainly in two ways, through increased export of eggs and larvae that eventually augment populations of target species 10,11 , or through increases in biomass of animals near MPA borders that ostensibly move into fished areas and are caught as “spillover” 12–15 . Numerous studies have reported evidence for the spillover of large, mobile taxa from MPAs into adjacent fished areas 16–19 . For example, 20 years after the implementation of a marine protected area in the Philippines, there was a tripling of fish density inside the reserve, as well as in the neighboring 200–300 m wide area just outside the reserve, a pattern attributed to spillover 20 . Patterns of density-driven spillover with potential benefits to fisheries have most often been observed for exploited species of mobile invertebrates, especially lobsters, in large part because they are intensively fished using stationary traps that can be placed at reserve borders 19,21 . Nevertheless, increased biomass and density within MPAs, and behavioral responses by fishers, such as “fishing the line” 22 , have not emerged for all reserves 23–28 . In some cases, spiny lobsters have even spilled into MPAs 29 . Despite much attention given to documenting spillover from MPAs, relatively few studies have attempted to quantify the extent to which increases in the density and size structure of animals along the borders of MPAs influences fishing behavior, total landings, and revenue 19 . We know of two studies, both conducted on lobsters, that measured the net gain in a fishery generated by spillover 30,31 . Goñi et al. 30 examined a heavily exploited lobster fishery in the Mediterranean Sea and found a net gain of 10% in total lobster weight caught after MPA implementation despite there being a decrease in the total number of individual lobsters caught.

The net benefit to the fishery was attributed in both cases to the spillover of relatively large lobsters from MPAs. Such studies are critical for demonstrating the ability of MPAs to meet their fishery objectives because without them the implementation of MPAs risks being perceived as having unfulfilled expectations and a lack of credibility in their purported value as an effective tool for fisheries management 32 . The long history of coastal MPAs in California (CA) provides a unique setting for studying their effects. Small coastal MPAs have existed in the state since the 1930s. Passage of the Marine Life Protection Act in 1999 led to the establishment of an additional 124 MPAs, encompassing 2197 km 2 of protected marine habitat, distributed along 1900 km of coastline 33 . Studies conducted within CA’s MPAs have focused primarily on understanding the biological and ecological consequences of protection. For example, researchers studying a network of MPAs at the Channel Islands in southern CA documented significant positive effects of protection on a wide variety of fish and invertebrate species within and immediately outside of reserve borders 34,35 . One of the largest responses was observed in the CA spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus), which increased dramatically in both biomass and size within multiple MPAs after only five years (2003–2008) of protection 21 , and exhibited spillover into adjacent fishing zones 36 . The rapid response of lobster to MPA protection was rather surprising because the lobster fishery in CA is considered relatively sustainable 37 . Whether the gain in lobster abundance in fishing zones adjacent to MPAs is sufficient to compensate for the reduction in fishable area created by the designation of MPAs has yet to be determined. The establishment of a network of no-take zones in 2012 along the mainland coast of southern CA, where CA spiny lobster is heavily fished, provided us with a unique opportunity to study the influence of MPAs and spillover on the lobster fishery and to determine its potential benefit to the commercial lobster fishery. Prior observations of spillover of lobster from MPAs within five years of establishment at the offshore Channel Islands 33 suggested that a similar pattern would emerge along the adjacent mainland coast, especially because the mainland fishery is more heavily fished than that at the Channel Islands 27,38 . Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the establish- ment of MPAs along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel would lead to increased lobster biomass and density inside MPAs, which in turn would lead to increased landings in the region despite the reduction in fishable area caused by the establishment of the MPAs. Our approach involved analyzing: (1) fishery independent data collected by divers within and outside of MPAs, immediately before and six years after MPA establishment, to determine the effects of the MPAs on lobster density, size and biomass, and (2) fishery dependent landings data of lobster catch and fishing effort, also collected six years before and after MPA establishment, to assess the effects of the MPAs on the fishery. Our results are important to fishers, who were assured spillover would even- tually enhance lobster catches, and fishery managers, who worked in collaboration with fishers to established reserves with fishery benefits. Results Fishery independent estimates of lobster abundance and size. The density of lobster increased significantly over time in both fished and unfished plots, however the rate that density increased in unfished MPA plots was three times higher than that in fished plots (Fig. 1a; F 1.248 = 5.53, P = 0.020 for protection status × time interaction). By contrast, the mean carapace length of lobster did not change significantly over time in either fished or unfished plots (Fig. 1b; F 1.182 = 2.12, P = 0.147 for protection status × time interaction), although it’s worth noting the non-significant trends in fished and unfished plots showed opposite patterns with size increasing over time in the unfished plots and decreasing in the fished plots. Similar patterns of non-significance and opposing directional trends were observed for changes in the median carapace length of lobster (F 1.182 = 2.16, P = 0.143, data not shown), which is more sensitive to skewed distributions. Observed changes in lobster biomass following MPA establishment closely resembled those of lobster den- sity (Fig. 1a vs. c). Biomass increased significantly over time following MPA establishment in both fished and unfished plots (F 1.131 = 4.65, P = 0.033 and F 1.118 = 62.45, P < 0.0001 for fished and unfished plots, respectively), with threefold higher increases in unfished MPA plots compared to fished plots (Fig. 1c; F 1.248 = 12.14, P < 0.001 for protection status × time interaction).

Analyses of commercial fishing block landing data showed that the effects of fishing block on the total annual catch of lobster differed signifi- cantly between the six-year periods before and af",

If these remote ecosystems remain vibrant, they could serve as biodiversity arks, able to repopulate more degraded locations (Roberts et al., 2002; Hoegh- Guldberg et al., 2018). For remote areas to repopulate denuded sites, they will have to be more resilient to the onslaught of disturbances associated with global cli- mate change. The absence of localized human impacts in many re- mote areas has the potential to promote resistance to and recovery from disturbances. A number of studies have found that localized human impacts can erode resilience, supporting the hypothesis that remote areas away from humans are likely to be more resilient. For example, over- fishing and climate change have reduced the resilience of kelp for- est ecosystems in Tasmania (Ling et al., 2019), logging has reduced the resilience of tropical forests in the Amazon (de Andrade et al., 2020), and overharvesting has reduced the resilience of salt marshes in the western Atlantic (Altieri et al., 2012). Although there is some evidence suggesting that coral reefs isolated from people could be more resilient to disturbance (Bellwood et al., 2006; Donovan et al., 2020, 2021; Sandin et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2016), the strength and generality of this relationship remains unclear. Here, we determined whether isolation increases the resilience of coral communities to disturbances associated with global climate change, including bleaching, storm damage, predator outbreaks, and disease (Bruno et al., 2007; Hughes et al., 2017; Madin et al., 2012; Uthicke et al., 2015). Reef- building corals live near their upper ther- mal limit. Consequently, decadal ocean warming, short- term marine heatwaves, and increasingly intense hurricanes are causing mass coral bleaching and mortality around the globe. This in turn has led to reductions in living coral cover and reef accretion (Alvarez- Filip et al., 2009; Perry & Alvarez- Filip, 2019; Perry et al., 2018), and a Received: 12 March 2021 | Revised: 7 September 2021 | Accepted: 7 September 2021 DOI: 10.1111/gcb.15904 PRIMARY RESEARCH ARTICLE Remoteness does not enhance coral reef resilience Justin H.

KEYWORDS climate change, coral reefs, disturbance, global impacts, local impacts, recovery, resilience 2 | BAUMANN et Al. loss in the ecosystem services coral reefs provide to humans such as coastal protection, tourism, and fisheries (Barbier et al., 2011). Isolated coral reefs tens to hundreds of kilometers from humans offer an important opportunity to determine whether reducing local- ized human impacts (e.g., fishing and pollution) promotes resilience to anthropogenic climate change. We tested the hypothesis that isolation from humans promotes coral reef resilience to large- scale disturbances. We compiled a global database of 57 peer- reviewed studies that measured coral community resistance to and recovery from acute, large- scale disturbances, including storms, predator outbreaks, bleaching, and disease. Our results suggest that reef re- moteness does not enhance resilience to disturbance. Instead, some of the most resilient reefs are close to large human populations. These findings have important implications for reef conservation and management. 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 | Study selection To test the hypothesis that reefs isolated from humans are more resilient, we conducted a global meta- analysis based on published monitoring studies that quantified changes in total hard (scleractin- ian) coral cover due to a documented large- scale acute disturbance including bleaching, storm damage, disease, and Acanthaster planci outbreaks (e.g., Edmunds, 2002; Graham et al., 2015; Holbrook et al., 2018; McClanahan et al., 2014). We queried ISI Web of Science using the following search term to build our database: ISI Web of Science Search Term: TI= (CORAL) AND TS= (\"CORAL COVER\") AND TS=(DISTURB* OR COTS OR STORM OR CYCLONE OR HURRICANE OR BLEACHING OR ACIDIFICATION OR EUTROPHICATION OR DISEASE OR RECOVER* OR DECLINE*) AND TS=(YEAR* OR TIME* OR TRAJECTORY). These studies tracked coral cover over time via diver surveys or video transects. We leveraged previously published coral cover change databases compiled by Graham et al. (2011) and Zhang et al. (2014) and added 134 new observations from 36 additional peer- reviewed studies to this database, resulting in 65 published studies and observations from 182 unique sites and four geographic regions: Caribbean Sea, Indian Ocean, West Pacific, and East Pacific (Table S1). We included data from peer- reviewed studies in our analysis if they met the following criteria: (i) a recorded acute disturbance event, (ii) estimated pre- disturbance coral cover, (iii) estimated post- disturbance coral cover, and (iv) coral cover after a recovery interval. Use of these criteria allowed us to calculate both aspects of resilience (recovery rate and resistance) as defined by Holling (1973) while also maximizing the amount of data we could use. As a result of this approach, we were able to extract data from a maximum of three time points at each site. Although more detailed time series were available at some sites, we elected to only retain coral cover data from up to three time points following the above criteria, for the sake of comparison. We included any studies that allowed us to estimate just resistance or just recovery or both. Fifty- seven studies documented resistance to (impact of) disturbances (based on data from 175 unique reef sites). Twenty studies that documented resis- tance did so within MPAs (at 57 unique sites). Fifty- six studies doc- umented coral recovery rates based on data from 181 unique reef sites. Twenty- six studies that documented coral recovery rates did so within MPAs (at 65 unique sites). Forty- five studies documented both resistance and recovery (Table S1). We excluded one study in the Arabian Gulf which met our criteria because it was the only study in the region that met the criteria. Notably, data from long- term monitoring programs such as Reef Life Survey or AGRRA were not included in our analysis, as most of these programs did not con- sistently record acute disturbance events. Coral taxa specific cover data were only available for 22% of reefs in this study and fish data were only available for 21% of reefs. As a result, the analysis was limited to total coral cover only. 2.2 | Data extraction We extracted coral cover data directly from text or tables when pos- sible. When coral cover data were only included in figures, we deter- mined coral cover values with plot digitization via webplotdigitizer. Coral cover was recorded at three intervals: pre- disturbance (before the acute disturbance event), post- disturbance (immediately follow- ing the acute disturbance event), and recovery (coral cover recorded after a post- disturbance recovery interval; Figure 1). For each site, we also categorized the location (latitude and lon- gitude) depth (min and max, range: 1– 30 m), and reef type (fringing reef, barrier reef, rocky reef, back reef, reef crest, atoll, patch reef, and lagoon). When site locations were presented in maps and fig- ures but not detailed in the paper, we used webplotdigitizer (Rohatgi, FIGURE 1 Conceptual diagram of resistance to and recovery from an acute disturbance.

Key words: competition; disturbance; foundation species; kelp forests; mathematical models. INTRODUCTION Disturbances are major sources of environmental vari- ability in many ecosystems and can play important roles in structuring ecological communities (Battisti et al. 2016). Disturbance can cause direct mortality, altered resource availability, and changes in ecosystem func- tion (Battisti et al. 2016). Foundation species, habitat- forming organisms that dominate an ecosystem’s bio- mass, are often disproportionately impacted by various forms of disturbance (Dayton 1972, Ellison et al. 2005). Usually at the base of the network of interactions that shape a given ecosystem, foundation species have strong connections to other organisms (Ellison 2019). Empiri- cal and experimental studies have shown that shifts in foundation species abundance can cascade to affect entire communities (Dayton 1972, Peters and Yao 2012, Crotty et al. 2018, Miller et al. 2018), suggesting that the effects of disturbances on community structure may be mediated by how much disturbance impacts foundation species. Understanding how disturbance and foundation spe- cies interact to influence community structure is of great importance to disturbance ecology. However, the role of temporally variable disturbance regimes and how they affect the dynamics of foundation species and the sur- rounding community remains only partially understood. To understand and predict how changes in disturbance intensity and frequency impact foundation species and, consequently, community composition and ecosystem function, studies of the effects of disturbance-driven fluctuations in foundation species abundance are needed (Castorani et al. 2018). Such studies are difficult to per- form, as natural disturbance often happens at scales that require great effort to manipulate or observe, and many foundation species are slow-growing. Mechanistic mod- els and study systems with dynamic foundation species can help with these challenges. Here, we use giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), a rapidly growing foundation species subject to variable disturbance regimes, to test these ideas. Often dominat- ing subtidal reefs in southern California (Graham 2004, Miller et al. 2018), giant kelp is unique among founda- tion species in that it shows rapid inter- and intra-annual fluctuations in biomass (Reed et al. 2008, Reed et al. 2011, Cavanaugh et al. 2011).

The presence of giant kelp regulates kelp forest struc- ture and function. The forests formed by giant kelp pro- foundly alter the reef habitat and are extremely productive ecosystems, supporting a diverse array of spe- cies (Schiel and Foster 2015, Miller et al. 2018). In addi- tion to providing an energy source for kelp forest herbivores and habitat for reef-dwelling organisms (Schiel and Foster 2015), giant kelp also alters the ben- thic environment, where macroalgae and sessile inverte- brates compete for physical space (Miller and Etter 2008, Arkema et al. 2009). The dense canopies formed by giant kelp can reduce the amount of light reaching the benthic community by up to 90% (Reed and Foster 1984, Santa Barbara Coastal LTER et al. 2020b). Shad- ing by canopies of giant kelp has been shown to nega- tively affect understory macroalgae, which require sufficient light to grow (Pearse and Hines 1979, Clark et al. 2004, Miller et al. 2011). Some studies suggest that, by shading the benthos, giant kelp indirectly facilitates sessile invertebrates that may otherwise be outcompeted by macroalgae (Arkema et al. 2009, Miller et al. 2015). Therefore, it is possible that the frequency and intensity of major kelp-removing storms may influence whether the benthos is dominated by sessile invertebrates or understory macroalgae. In order to synthesize these observations into a predic- tive framework, we developed a mechanistic model of the interactions between giant kelp, understory macroal- gae, and sessile invertebrates that enabled us to quantify the cascading effects of variable disturbance frequency and intensity on benthic community composition (Fig. 1). Our model captured the dynamic response of giant kelp to disturbance by storms as well as the result- ing effects on competition between benthic community members. We validated the model using a 20-yr data set on giant kelp abundance and benthic community FIG. 1. Conceptual diagram of the system. (a) Life cycle of giant kelp and the main interactions between adult (mature) giant kelp, understory macroalgae, and sessile invertebrates. (b) Reef following a winter with mild storms; there is a dense canopy of mature giant kelp and the benthos is dominated by sessile invertebrates. (c) Reef following a winter with severe storms; there is some juvenile giant kelp, and the benthos is dominated by understory macroalgae.

Article e03304; page 2A. RAINE DETMER ET AL.Ecology, Vol. xx, No. xx composition collected as part of the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) program. We simulated a range of storm regimes to quantify how direct disturbance (i.e., storm removal of benthic community members), foundation species-medi- ated disturbance (i.e., cascading effects mediated by giant kelp shading), and their combination impact ben- thic community composition. The model predicted shifts in benthic community composition that were largely consistent with empirical data, and it showed sensitivity to both the frequency and intensity of storms. Thus, our validated model allowed us to predict how changing dis- turbance regimes may impact community structure via effects on foundation species. T HEMODEL A stage-structured model for giant kelp Giant kelp has a heteromorphic life cycle, with the large, canopy-forming diploid sporophyte generation alternating with small haploid gametophytes (Schiel and Foster 2015). Following other models of kelp population dynamics (Nisbet and Bence 1989, Burgman and Gerard 1990), we modeled giant kelp abundance using a three- stage model that accounts for the settlement of gameto- phytes, their recruitment into sporophytes, and the mat- uration of these sporophytes into adults (Fig. 1). Gametophytes (G) arise from spores produced by external populations at a rateσ ext as well as by local adults at a rateσ A (see Table 1 for a list of all variables, parameters, and their meanings). Gametophytes recruit to the sporophyte stage at an intrinsic recruitment rate r G modified by the amount of light reaching the bottom L benthos (Rosenthal et al. 1974).

KeywordsDensity dependence!Coral fundamental traits!Corallivory!Staghorn coral Introduction The density of stony corals varies across multiple spatial and temporal scales, yet we lack a core understanding of how changes in coral colony density (hereafter, coral density) alter dynamics of coral populations. Ecological theory holds that the long-term persistence of populations is facilitated when population density alters one or more demographic rates (Murdoch and Walde1989). Specifi- cally, a negative relationship between density and popu- lation growth rate can bound populations at high density and promote population growth at low density. By con- trast, a very low or negative per capita growth rate at low population densities has a destabilizing influence and can lead to extirpation (Courchamp et al.1999). Conse- quently, lower colony densities may reduce competitive dynamics within or among species and allow coral pop- ulations to rebound. Alternatively, declines in coral den- sity may lead to negative per capita growth rates, which would destabilize coral populations and increase risk of extinction. Therefore, resolving the link between coral fundamental traits like colony growth or survival and coral density will sharpen our ability to forecast the capacity of coral populations to rebound following major declines in density.

Our review revealed that, to date, corallivory has received relatively limited attention as a mechanism that alters fundamental traits, despite mounting evidence for its importance to coral (Rotjan and Lewis2008; Lenihan et al.2011,2015) and theory high- lighting the role predators can have in shaping density dependence in demographic rates (Murdoch1994). Preda- tors can regulate growth of prey populations by increasing the per capita mortality of prey at higher prey densities (Janzen1970; Connell1971; Murdoch1994; Schmitt and Holbrook2007) through increases in foraging rates of individual predators, aggregation of predators to areas of higher prey density, and/or an overall increase in abun- dance via a demographic response to an increased food supply. Alternatively, increases in prey density can posi- tively affect per capita survival of prey, where high prey densities dilute predator effects (Murdoch1994). Lastly, predators can reduce the capacity of prey populations to recover when predators concentrate their foraging on low density prey populations, a situation known as a predator pit (Bakun2006). Therefore, how predators respond to variation in prey density has the potential to either stabilize or destabilize dynamics of prey populations. Studies have shown that highly mobile corallivores can aggregate in areas of higher coral density (Shantz et al. 2011) and that the feeding rate of an individual corallivore can increase as coral density increases (Roff et al.2011). However, it is unclear whether the observed responses of these corallivores to variation in coral density acted to regulate or destabilize coral populations because the link between the behavioral responses and effects on per capita mortality of coral was not explored. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that corallivory is a key mecha- nism underlying the effects of coral density on coral growth and survival. Specifically, we quantified how the skeletal growth and colony survival of the staghorn coral, Acropora pulchra,varied with density in the presence and absence of corallivores. We focused on small-sized colo- nies for two related reasons. First, they represent a critical phase in the establishment of a new thicket of staghorn, either via sexual reproduction or asexual fragmentation, where the risk of whole-colony mortality is much greater than for larger colonies. Second, asA. pulchracolonies increase in size, they become protected by territorial farmerfishes that ward off both herbivorous and coralliv- orous species of fishes (Johnson et al.2011). Therefore, a small (juvenile) life stage is most susceptible to complete removal (and thereby extirpation) by corallivores and thus provides a more direct test of the predator pit hypothesis in this system. Materials and methods Study site, species, and experimental design We conducted a 30-day experiment on the northern shore of Moorea, French Polynesia (17.5388°S, 149.8295°W) from July–August, 2018. Moorea’s shallow lagoons (1–4 m depth) are characterized by patch reefs formed by live and dead colonies of mounding species ofPorites interspersed with sand and coral rubble. BranchingAcro- poracorals commonly grow on the tops of thesePorites reefs and vary naturally in density (Johnson et al.2011; Lenihan et al.2011). Our study focused onA. pulchradue to this known variation in density, as well as its high growth rate and sensitivity to predation pressure (Kamath et al.2019). To quantify how corallivory pressure changes as a function of coral density, we used a factorial experimental design crossing three levels of coral density with two levels of corallivore exposure (Fig.1). We harvestedA. pulchra coral nubbins, each 70–80 mm in length with no secondary branches (i.e., to mimic a young juvenile), from 6 thickets of adult colonies in a lagoon near our experimental site. We then affixed the nubbins to artificial bases using underwater epoxy (Z-Spar A-788 Splash Zone Epoxy), and measured their vertical extension (VE), total linear extension (TLE), and buoyant mass (Davies1989) before deployment. We then randomized their assignment to the three density treatments, using the average density of branch tips (*350 m -2 ) in nearby natural staghorn patches as the high density treatment (see Supplemental Materials). The low density treatment consisted of a single nubbin (affixed to a base ‘platform’ to facilitate deployment) (n = 12 for each corallivore treatment); the medium density had 4 nubbins evenly spaced 13 cm apart on a square platform (equiva- lent to*172 nubbins m -2 ; n = 8); and high density had 8 nubbins spaced in the same configuration but 6 cm from a neighbor (equivalent to 345 nubbins m -2 ; n = 8). Half of the replicates of each density treatment were left exposed to corallivores, while the other half was enshrouded in a thin-gauge vinyl-coated 6.25 cm 2 mesh wire cage that excluded larger corallivorous fishes but did not impede flow and light (Schmitt et al.2019). Following the rationale of other predator-exclusion field experiments (e.g., Thorp and Bergey1981), we did not include a cage control (e.g., partial cage treatment) as predators in this system are attracted to structures (Schmitt and Holbrook2007). A pair of caged and uncaged replicates of the same density treatment were deployed*0.5 m apart atop aPorites bommie (patch reef); replicate patch reefs were spaced at least one meter apart and distributed over an area of roughly 3000 m 2 (see Fig. S1, Supplemental Materials). Coral Reefs 123 The spatial scale of the experiment is smaller than the home range of the major excavating corallivores in this system (e.g.,Balistapus undulatus,Balistoides viridescens, Arothron meleagris; Johnson et al.2011), so we assume that we distributed patches of different resource densities over a relatively uniform landscape of corallivory. For each corallivore treatment, we deployed 28 platforms collec- tively holding 108 nubbins (experiment total = 216 nub- bins on 56 platforms). After 30 days, we collected all nubbins and re-measured their VE, TLE, and buoyant mass in the laboratory. We revisited the plots 8 months after deployment and found that cage surfaces did not require cleaning, presumably because herbivory kept them almost completely free of macroalgae (Figure S2); only a few cages became some- what more fouled after 12 months when surviving experi- mental corals were re-measured. After a year, corals protected from predators grew extensively and when pre- sent, often fused with neighbors; this meant that we could only compare the change in total",

Halpern 1,3 Received: 11 June 2020 / Accepted: 1 February 2021 © The Author(s) 2021 Abstract Herbivorous fish can increase coral growth and survival by grazing down algal competitors. With coral reefs in global decline, maintaining adequate herbivory has become a primary goal for many managers. However, herbivore biomass targets assume grazing behavior is consistent across different reef systems, even though relatively few have been studied. We docu- ment grazing behavior of two scarid species in Antigua, Barbuda, and Bonaire. Our analyses show significant differences in intraspecific feeding rates, time spent grazing, and intensity of grazing across sites, which may alter the ecological impact of a given scarid population. We suggest several hypothesized mechanisms for these behavioral variations that would benefit from explicit testing in future research. As managers set targets to enhance herbivory on reefs, it is critical that we understand potential differences in scarid grazing impact. Our findings demonstrate the variability of grazing behavior across different reef sites and call for further investigation of the drivers and ecological implications of these inconsistencies. Introduction Herbivorous fishes can play a critical role in coral reef eco- systems by suppressing algae and thereby facilitating coral growth, recruitment, and survival (Box and Mumby 2007; Rasher and Hay 2010; Steneck et al. 2014). In recent dec- ades, coral reefs have become increasingly threatened by diverse anthropogenic impacts, including overfishing of her- bivorous fish populations (Hughes et al. 2007; Edwards et al. 2014). Insufficient herbivory can allow algae to outcompete corals for space, ultimately driving shifts from coral to algal dominance that have occurred in much of the Caribbean region (Jackson et al. 2014). Coral reef fisheries thus can- not simply manage for sustainable yields as in traditional fisheries, but must also consider the levels of persistent her- bivory required to maintain critical ecosystem functions. Increasing attention has been given to understanding how much herbivory is needed to sustain coral reef health and to identify thresholds of herbivore biomass that can be used to guide fisheries management targets (McClanahan et al. 2011; Adam et al. 2015; Karr et al. 2015). However, all herbivorous fish are not the same in terms of their grazing impact on reefs, and variation can occur both among and within species. Studies have highlighted func- tional differences across species and size classes in terms of feeding morphology, selectivity, and foraging distribution within a reefscape (Bruggemann et al. 1994, 1996; Bonaldo and Bellwood 2008; Lokrantz et al. 2008; Ong and Holland 2010; Burkepile and Hay 2011; Rasher et al. 2013; Afeworki et al. 2013; Adam et al. 2015, 2018; Hoey 2018). Selec- tive exclusions of different herbivorous fish species result in distinct algal communities (Burkepile and Hay 2011), high- lighting the ecological significance of interspecific differ- ences in functional roles among herbivores and suggesting that simple targets for total herbivore populations may be inadequate in managing for coral reef health. In addition to established interspecific and size-specific differences, environmental contexts can also drive variabil- ity in herbivore behavior. Several empirical studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of behaviors such as foraging and movement to predator presence (Madin et al. 2010b; Davis et al. 2017); reef rugosity (Catano et al. 2014); grazing behaviors of proximate herbivores (Gil and Hein 2017); and the abundance, distribution, and nutritional content of algal Responsible Editor: A.

In some cases, these behavioral variations have been explicitly linked to larger ecosystem impacts. For example, fishing- induced declines in predatory fish abundances can increase grazing ranges of herbivorous fish and alter seascape-level algal distribution patterns (Madin et al. 2010b; DiFiore et al. 2019). Despite a growing understanding of the ecological impor- tance of herbivore behavior and its sensitivity to environ- mental conditions, many efforts to predict herbivore impact on reefs assume species- and size-specific feeding rates that remain constant across different reef environments, over- looking factors such as fishing pressure and habitat shifts that, as noted above, have the potential to dramatically alter grazing behaviors. For example, many reef models use grazing behavior data from one or two locations (e.g., Mumby et al. 2006; Bozec et al. 2016; Perry et al. 2018) which—while still valuable—may not accurately represent dynamics on other reefs. Other studies have struggled to establish links between herbivore biomass and reef health (e.g., McClanahan et al. 2011; Karr et al. 2015; Bruno et al. 2019), which could reflect variation in herbivore behavior that makes biomass an incomplete metric of herbivory. If herbivore feeding activity is suppressed under degraded reef conditions, such as low reef structural complexity or low fish populations, the biomass of herbivorous fish identified as capable of maintaining reef function in pristine systems may be insufficient in degraded environments. Insufficient herbivory may of course further reef degradation, potentially forming a reinforcing feedback loop (Mumby and Steneck 2008; Nyström et al. 2012; Bozec et al. 2013; Adam et al. 2015). Knowledge gaps around herbivore grazing behaviors are particularly important as we seek to manage individual reef ecosystems that vary greatly in terms of reef context and condition. Here we assess both interspecific and intraspecific vari- ability in multiple components of feeding behavior for two scarid (parrotfish) species across reef sites around three Car- ibbean islands and discuss potential underlying mechanisms, ecological consequences, and management implications. We provide a framework of hypothesized pathways in which human activities may alter reef function through impacts on herbivore behavior that motivate future research and can be used to guide management. Materials and methods Study sites Caribbean reefs vary greatly in terms of anthropogenic impacts and reef condition. Our study focused on 13 reef sites off the islands of Bonaire, Antigua, and Barbuda (Fig. 1) that encompass a range of benthic and fish com- munity conditions. Bonaire has among the highest live coral cover and herbivorous fish biomass in the Caribbean region (Jackson et al. 2014), likely a result of longstanding fishing restrictions that include the prohibition of parrotfish harvest Fig. 1 Map of the Caribbean region highlighting Barbuda, Antigua, and Bonaire, the three islands included in this study. Inset maps show the locations of each study site within these three islands Marine Biology (2021) 168:53 1 3 Page 3 of 11 53 (Steneck et al. 2019). Antiguan and Barbudan reefs are more representative of many Caribbean reefs today (Jackson et al. 2014), with relatively low coral cover and high algal abun- dances, as well as reduced fish stocks due to substantial local fishing pressure. All three islands receive regular wave and wind exposure from the east and northeast, and sites were selected on relatively sheltered western- and southwestern- facing shores for dive feasibility. Surveys All data were collected between March and August of 2017. Reef characteristics were assessed at 10 m depth to con- trol for the influence of depth on algal growth rates, with behavioral observations of fish initiated between 8 and 12 m depths. Behavioral data were discarded if focal fish left a 5–15 m depth range during the observation period. Behavioral observations We observed grazing behavior of two dominant scarid spe- cies, Sparisoma viride and Scarus vetula, at each of our 13 study sites. We targeted these species because of their rela- tive abundance as well as their contrasting grazing mecha- nisms. S. vetula takes relatively shallow, scraping bites and ingests mostly epilithic algae, or algae growing on a substrate’s surface. S. viride is an excavating grazer, tak- ing deeper bites containing large amounts of both endolithic algae, which grow within the skeleton of a substrate such as dead coral or porous rock, and crustose algae, which form a thin crust on a substrate’s surface (Bruggemann et al. 1994). This analysis focuses only on initial phase (female) individu- als due to their relatively high abundance and to eliminate potential interactions between territorial male behavior and feeding patterns. A size window of 15–30 cm forklength was used to reduce the potentially confounding effects of fish size on feeding behaviors. Prior to data collection, three divers conducted under- water size calibrations with marked PVC reference pipes to ensure consistency and accuracy of fish forklength estimates. PVC dive sleeves (tubes on which data were recorded) were marked at 5 cm increments to provide size references during data collection. Practice dives were completed at the onset of the Bonaire, Antigua, and Barbuda data collection peri- ods, during which divers took turns observing each other’s fish follows to ensure consistency in diver behavior and data notation.

KeywordsIndo-pacific lionfish Pterois volitans Pterois miles Invasive species Naivete ́  Coral reefs Social– ecological systems Predation Introduction The ecological impacts of invasive species can have major economic, social, and cultural consequences (Pejchar and Mooney2009). However, the effects of invasive species are not uniformly negative, and there is increasing attention to how the impact and function of invasive species can vary geographically (Davis et al.2011; Lockwood and Robinson 2014; Doherty and Ritchie2016). For example, in certain localities invasive plants can have null or positive effects on nesting native birds (Gleditsch and Carlo2014). More generally, invasive species can offer novel socioeconomic opportunities (resource extraction, tourism; Pejchar and Mooney2009). Quantifying the ecological and social sig- nificance of invasive species in different locations can facilitate an understanding of trade-offs between costly removals of invaders versus a more complex characteri- zation of what it means to accept novel species in social– ecological systems riddled by ‘‘wicked problems’’ (Rittel and Webber1973). On coral reefs, there are few examples of successful invasions by vertebrate predators. A conspicuous exception is the introduction of Indo-Pacific lionfishes (Pterois voli- tansandP. miles) to the Atlantic in the 1980s and their rapid spread in the 2000s. Invasive lionfish are voracious generalist predators with venomous spines that act as a built-in defense against native predators (Co ˆ te ́ et al.2013). Exponential increases in invasive lionfish abundance in some areas have raised serious conservation concerns for native prey communities (e.g., Ingeman2016). The Topic Editor Alastair Harborne Jameal F. Samhouri and Adrian C. Stier contributed equally to this work. &Jameal F.

As in many ecosystems (Ritchie and Johnson 2009), the loss of apex predators on Caribbean reefs has caused an increase in the abundance of smaller predators such as small groupers and snappers (Stallings2009). This increase in smaller predators, also known as mesopreda- tors, threatens the abundance and biodiversity of coral reef fishes (Stier et al.2017). The lionfish invasion may exac- erbate these mesopredator threats given that lionfish can play a similar trophic role to native mesopredators (Albins 2013; Ellis and Faletti2016; Curtis et al.2017). For these reasons and others, there is a growing appreciation that the impacts of lionfish on native coral reef communities are likely to be heavily context-dependent, and mediated by the abundance, influences, and naivete ́ of native predators, competitors, and prey (Anton et al.2016; Ingeman et al. 2017). However, there is an incomplete understanding of how lionfish abundance varies relative to native meso- predator abundance, and of the relative impacts of lionfish and native mesopredators on native prey species. Here, we provide evidence from Caribbean Panama and beyond that lionfish are less abundant than native meso- predators and that lionfish impacts on one common prey species are indistinguishable from a native mesopredator. Our results provide support for the view that management of invasive lionfish may be succeeding in some places and that continuation of control efforts requires nuanced con- sideration in relation to specific conservation goals and in relation to other environmental concerns. Methods Observational surveys We conducted two types of flashlight-assisted visual sur- veys at three different sites near Bocas del Toro, Panama (Punta Caracol, Casa Blanca, Casa Verde), in January 2015. First, we counted lionfish, native predators, and potential prey for these predators on 24 patch reefs. Two divers counted all non-cryptic fishes on each patch reef, which primarily consisted of the coralsOrbicellaspp. and Agariciaspp. Following surveys, divers measured the area of the reef approximated by the product of its maximum width and length in meters, compared their fish observa- tions, and scored a predator species as present on a patch reef if at least one diver detected it. For prey, we averaged the counts of individualsB5 cm TL across divers. Patch reefs averaged 1-2 m 2 in area (range: 0.3–3.3 m 2 ), and those we surveyed were generally 2–10 m apart from one another. All surveys were conducted during the day, and flashlights were used to look inside dark crevices. Second, we conducted timed roving diver surveys of lionfish and two types of native mesopredator, the graysby Cephalopholis cruentataand hamletsHypoplectrusspp., at each site. In these surveys (which did not focus on indi- vidual patch reefs but rather the full matrix of habitat at each site), teams of three divers swam for 20 min each*1 m above the substrate and along consistent depth contours of 4 m and 8 m. Counts focused on the mesopredators sighted directly below each diver and were summed within a team of divers to compare predator abundances (Table S1). We conducted three analyses to quantify whether native mesopredators were more common than invasive lionfish. First, we tested the hypothesis that invasive and native mesopredators occupied an equal proportion of reefs by analyzing a generalized linear mixed model (logit link, binomial distribution) of occurrence as a function of predator type (native or invasive), with site as a random effect. Second, we tested the hypothesis that native and invasive mesopredators differed in conditional density (i.e., density when present). Because not all mesopredator spe- cies were present at all sites, we pooled all native meso- predators together and compared the conditional density of native mesopredators to lionfish using a Student’st-test. Third, we tested the hypothesis that invasive and native mesopredators were equally abundant during the timed surveys at the three sites by comparing mesopredator abundance across observer teams using a one-way ANOVA with survey sites as the replicates. In the patch reef surveys, one prey species, the masked gobyCoryphopterus personatus, was conspicuously more abundant than other prey species, forming large shoals above individual reefs where we observed multiple predator species stalking and striking them. To test the hypothesis that the masked goby was more abundant than all other prey species summed together, we analyzed a generalized linear mixed model of log-transformed densi- ties to compare these two groups, using site as a random effect. Because our predator surveys in Panama reflect a snapshot in time from one region, we also analyzed observational data from the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (www.reef.org) database, collected during surveys conducted across eight regions in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic in the six years leading up to our study 2010–2015. The REEF database compiles informa- tion from volunteer divers who use a roving diver tech- nique to count all fishes observed during a dive, as well as metadata including location, date, time, and habitat. Expert density is a weighted average index based on the frequency of observations by expert REEF divers in different abun- dance categories (1, 2–10, 11–100,[100 individuals). A dive without any reported sighting of a fish species is 1594Coral Reefs (2021) 40:1593–1600 123 interpreted as 0 individuals for that dive. We used a Welch’s two-samplet-test to compare expert densities of lionfish and graysby, treating regional means from 2010 to 2015 as replicates (Table S2). Experimental test of lionfish and native mesopredator impacts In January–February 2015, we conducted a laboratory experiment to test whether the direct effects of lionfish on native masked gobies differed from the effects of the native graysby,in Bocas del Toro, Panama, at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. 1 We focused on this prey species because it was highly abundant and we observed lionfish and native mesopredators feeding voraciously on these gobies in the field.

HOLT, DOMINIQUE GRAVEL, ADRIAN STIER AND JAMES ROSINDELL 12.1 Introduction A hidden dimension of food web ecology almost since its inception has been a concern with space and spatial dynamics. One of thefirst food webs ever scribbled onto paper was a hand-drawn diagram Charles Elton sketched as an undergraduate, during an expedition to the Svalbard region north of Norway (Summerhayes & Elton, 1923). The food web he drew for Bear Island depicts spatial interactions among the marine realm, terrestrial habitats and bodies of freshwater, mediated by the movement of colonial seabirds from their foraging grounds to their nesting arenas (a process now called‘spatial subsidy’; Polis et al., 1997; Graham et al., 2018). Elton maintained an interest in the spatial aspects of communities through his life. One of his last publications, the rarely read tomeThe pattern of animal communities(Elton, 1966), contained two essential spatial insights about food webs. Elton noted that‘The pyramid of numbers, really a pyramid of consumer layers [trophic levels], is matched by...the inverse pyramid of habitat’. Namely, species at higher trophic levels often range further and so have to be examined at larger spatial scales. This means species at higher trophic ranks can spatially couple dynamics of communities at lower trophic ranks, an insight that resonates to the present day (e.g. McCann et al., 2005). Moreover, echoing his youthful excursion to the frigid Arctic, he states‘no habitat component with its animal community is a closed system...the struc- tural boundaries...are constantly passed by population movement... every community unit is partly interlocked with others, not necessarily its nearest neighbours...’. This statement could be viewed as a harbinger of Comp. by: 201508 Stage: Proof Chapter No.: 12 Title Name: MatthewsEtal Date:22/6/20 Time:17:54:20 Page Number: 290 today’s concern with metacommunity processes (Holt, 1997; Leibold et al., 2004; Leibold & Chase, 2018). However, for most of its history, food web ecology has largely focussed on local interactions. Amarasekare (2008) notes‘scant empirical evidence of spatial effects in food webs’. Even thefine recent volume Adaptive food webs(2018) only marginally deals with food webs in a spatial context. Montoya and Galiana (2018), however, do provide a useful perspective on how to relate species interaction networks to biogeog- raphy. They note several distinct modalities of spatial processes at play in food web ecology. First, there now exist preliminary attempts to expli- citly integrate island biogeography and food web theory via influences of food web interactions on the colonization and extinction processes generating species’occupancy patterns (Holt, 1996, 1997, 2010; Gravel et al., 2011; Massol et al., 2017). Second, there is growing recognition that taxa at different trophic levels can have distinct spatial strategies, for example the coupling of spatially separated habitats by mobile consumers (e.g. McCann et al., 2005; Rooney et al., 2008), related to the broader theme of spatial subsidies and spatial ecosystem ecology (Polis et al., 1996; Massol et al., 2011). Third, dispersal in metacommunities can permit the persistence of otherwise unfeasible configurations of species interactions (Amarasekare, 2008); area effects on species persistence can reflect within-island spatial dynamics (Holt, 1992), which can be par- ticularly important in fostering the persistence of strong food web inter- actions (e.g. see Wilson et al., 1998 for a food chain example). Yet these three components of merging food web and spatial ecology have yet to be comprehensively integrated. Montoya and Galiana (2018) note that one potential approach to integrating food web ecology with biogeography is to examine how food web properties vary along major environmental gradients. Pre- eminent among such gradients are those spatial attributes of habitats at the heart of island biogeography theory (MacArthur & Wilson, 1967; Whittaker & Fernández-Palacios, 2007)–the area of islands or isolated habitat patches and their distance to potential sources of colonists. Baiser et al. (2012) examined the food webs of pitcher plants (Sarracenia pur- purea) and showed that food web attributes–food chain length, total species richness, linkage density and incidence of omnivores–increased with pitcher volume. Gravel et al. (2018) point to the rapidly growing evidence that the structure of ecological networks varies by habitat, through time and across gradients. A systematic understanding of how area influences network attributes–such as the number of species in each 290· Holt, Gravel, Stier and Rosindell Comp. by: 201508 Stage: Proof Chapter No.: 12 Title Name: MatthewsEtal Date:22/6/20 Time:17:54:20 Page Number: 291 trophic rank–is clearly emerging as a key desideratum for current research. Species coexistence mechanisms can also be scale dependent (Holt, 1993; Chesson, 2018) and variation in species richness with area could reflect the breakdown of such mechanisms at small spatial scales. For example, Orrock and Fletcher (2005) showed that the respective roles of stochasticity and competitive ability in driving competitive outcomes can change with habitat size. The principal ingredient of quantitative, dynamical food webs–interaction strength–can itself vary with island area (e.g. Schoener et al., 2016). Martinson and Fagan (2014) carried out a meta-analysis of plant–insect herbivore interactions in fragmented landscapes and found that plants on small, isolated fragments enjoyed almost 50 per cent less herbivory than plants in large patches. Across a range of island and patch sizes, Connor et al. (2000) observed that animal densities are higher in larger areas. Ecological interactions are typically‘dosage-dependent’, so for instance competition intensity increases with the densities of competitors, implying a likely systematic signal of area on interspecific interaction strength (as found in parasitoid– host interactions by Fenoglio et al., 2013)–with implications for the spatial scaling of species richness. Island biogeography has dealt with trophic interactions and food web structure, but not as a central theme. As Holt (2010) noted, MacArthur and Wilson (1967) do not directly discuss food webs at all, but do obliquely hint at how local food web interactions can govern coloniza- tion and extinction and, thus, island community structure. The synthesis of island biogeography by Whittaker and Fernández-Palacios (2007) touches on predation and food chains several times. Two telling examples they cite from classic island studies are: i) that Thornton (1996) ascribed several extinctions of birds on Anak Krakatau to top avian predators (whose numbers were sustained, it appears, by the ability of raptors to move among several islands, an example of the spatial scaling of movement with trophic rank hypothesized by Elton in 1966); and ii) that Lomolino (1984) demonstrated that the carnivorous shrewBlarina brevicaudadrove extinctions of a mammalian prey species,Microtus penn- sylvanicus, on islands in the Thousand Island region of the St. Lawrence River. Harold Heatwole (Heatwole & Levins, 1972; Heatwole, 2018) examined islands in the Caribbean and off Australia and argued that insular trophic structure (the relative proportion of species in major trophic groups such as detritivores, herbivores and predators) can be relatively stable, even if species composition is in continualflux. Piechnik et al. (2008) re-examined the classic Simberloff-Wilson experimental On the Interface of Food Webs and Spatial Ecology·291 Comp. by: 201508 Stage: Proof Chapter No.: 12 Title Name: MatthewsEtal Date:22/6/20 Time:17:54:20 Page Number: 292 defaunation of mangrove islets and reported a signature of trophic breadth in the order of colonization, with generalist consumers arriving first in community assembly (see also Cirtwill & Stouffer, 2016). These examples show that the presence or absence of predators and trophic attributes such as dietary specialization can influence the primary drivers of community assembly on islands–extinction and colonization–an issue we examine more closely in Sections 12.3 and 12.4. A principal goal of the theory of island biogeography was to develop a dynamic explanation for the species–area and species–distance relation- ships on true islands. There are many kinds of species–area relationships (SARs), including for instance different kinds of species accumulation curves within contiguous land masses (Scheiner, 2003) and we touch on several below. In island biogeography and analyses of habitat fragmentation, the focus is typically on the Type IV curves of Scheiner (2003), which describe species richness across‘true’or‘habitat’islands or distinct geographical domains varying in area (also termed island species– area relationships or ISARs, see Chapter 1). Over some spatial scales, ISARs nicelyfit the classic power law,S=cA z , wherecis a parameter representing a kind of carrying capacity per unit area andzis a parameter that indicates how area (A) boosts species richness (S) (Triantis et al., 2012; Matthews et al., 2016). Equivalently, we havez¼ ∂logSðÞ ∂logAðÞ . This expression usefully characterizes the strength of the relationship between species richness and area, even if the power law does not hold (i.e.zcan vary withA). A null expectation might be that the parameters defining the strength of the species–area relationship are not influenced by trophic rank or interactions. Indeed, Drakare et al. (2006) reviewed species–area rela- tionships (largely for nested or contiguous species–area curves) from a wide range of systems and concluded that there was no significant signal of ",

Ecology Letters(2020) INTRODUCTION As human activities continue to expand in magnitude, number and extent (Venteret al. 2016; Watsonet al. 2016; Halpern et al. 2019), a growing body of literature has documented widespread human impacts on animal behaviour across aqua- tic and terrestrial ecosystems (Wong & Candolin 2015; Larson et al. 2016; Shannonet al. 2016; Gaynoret al. 2018; Tucker et al. 2018; Samia et al. 2019; Suraciet al. 2019). Animal behaviour underlies many critical ecological functions, includ- ing nutrient cycling, primary productivity, pathogen transfer and habitat provision (Gribbenet al. 2009; Barber & Dinge- manse 2010; Palkovacs & Dalton 2012). By affecting both interspecific and intraspecific interactions, behavioural trait variation can alter population and community dynamics (Bol- nicket al. 2011) and wildlife conservation outcomes (Festa- Bianchet & Apollonio 2003; Blumstein & Fern   andez-Juricic 2010; Berger-tal & Saltz 2016), yet we know little about whether the type or magnitude of human-induced behavioural shifts translate into ecological change. While many beha- vioural effect studies allude to the implications of their find- ings for populations, communities and ecosystems, limited empirical and theoretical investigation as well as a lack of syn- thesis across existing literature spheres preclude us from knowing where and to what degree these impacts occur, limit- ing our ability to guide and prioritise management efforts. Without an enhanced understanding of the ecological conse- quences of human-induced behavioural effects, we risk both overlooking important drivers of ecological change that are not addressed through traditional management strategies, and misallocating management resources to mitigating behavioural impacts that ultimately have little ecological relevance. While recent frameworks and case studies have linked numerical declines of animal populations to ecological conse- quences (Esteset al. 2011; Dirzoet al. 2014), we lack a similar understanding of the behaviourally mediated pathways through which humans impact ecosystems. Here, we present a novel framework outlining the pathways through which human activities may modify ecosystems via changes in ani- mal behaviour. We begin by categorising the mechanisms through which human activities affect animal behaviour, syn- thesising a broad literature on human-induced behaviour change that previous reviews have segregated by ecosystem [e.g. forests (Marzano & Dandy 2012)], behaviour [e.g. flight (Stankowich 2008)] or human disturbance [e.g. noise (Wil- liamset al. 2015; Shannonet al. 2016)]. We then present detailed pathways linking documented animal behaviour changes to established or hypothesised ecosystem conse- quences. While our integrative framework illustrates the potential for human-impacted behaviours to affect population dynamics, community interactions and ecosystem functions, we identify numerous factors likely to dampen these various pathways and discuss the relevance of these factors for antici- pating and managing the ecological consequences of beha- viour change. While much remains to be learned about the drivers of animal behaviour change, we highlight ©2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS Ecology Letters, (2020)doi: 10.1111/ele.13571 comparatively large knowledge gaps around the actualised ecological impacts of many human-impacted animal beha- viours that prevent us from drawing management recommen- dations from many existing studies. As this body of literature continues to grow, we advocate for an increase in empirical and modelling studies that go beyond documenting behavioural impacts to examine the potential for realised ecological implications of human-induced animal behaviour change. MECHANISMS FOR HUMAN-INDUCED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR CHANGE Human activities are increasingly impacting the aquatic and terrestrial environments in which wildlife persist. In addition to our growing population and rising urban and agricultural development, technological advances enable us to access and modify previously remote environments (Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2011; Pertierraet al. 2017), and increased participation in outdoor recreation expands our anthropogenic footprint in natural areas once thought of as protected and pristine (Gon- sonet al. 2016; Watsonet al. 2016). Even when not directly present, human disturbance permeates ecosystems through chemical and sensory pollution (Longcore & Rich 2004; Wil- liamset al. 2015), habitat modification (Torreset al. 2016), trash deposition (Newsome & van Eeden 2017), human-facili- tated invasive species (Murphy & Romanuk 2013) and anthropogenic climate change (Rosenzweiget al. 2008; Hoegh-Guldberg & Bruno 2010). These diverse human impacts can induce changes in animal behaviour by altering the conditions under which animals make behavioural decisions. Direct human presence and indi- rect impacts on an animal’s surroundings can alter behaviour via changes in population densities, top-down effects, bottom- up effects and changes in the physical environment (Fig. 1). We introduce these four mechanisms here, integrating previ- ously disparate literature to establish a foundation for assess- ing human-induced behaviour change pathways more coherently. Selected examples for each empirically docu- mented pathway are provided in Table S1. Population density effects By changing the density of a given population, humans can alter numerous behaviours that are sensitive to population size. For example reducing local wildlife abundances through culling has been shown to alter territorial behaviours and increase mixing between social units inMeles meles(Eurasian badger) populations (Carteret al. 2007). Reduced male to female ratios due to selective hunting of maleSaiga tatarica (Saiga antelope) led to disruptions of harem breeding dynam- ics in which older females aggressively prevented subdominant females from mating (Milner-Gullandet al. 2003). Other social behaviours such as group foraging (MacNultyet al. 2012; Gil & Hein 2017) and shared vigilance (Beauchamp et al. 2012; Gilet al. 2017) have been established as sensitive to group size and could inferably be impacted by human-in- duced changes in population density, though these potential links have not been documented empirically. Top-down effects Humans can have top-down impacts on animal behaviour by directly or indirectly altering how and where animals perceive risk [i.e. ‘landscapes of fear’ (Laundreet al. 2010; Gaynor et al. 2019; Suraciet al. 2019)]. Animals adjust their beha- viours when they perceive direct human presence as a threat, even in response to benign activities such as hiking or boating (Larsonet al. 2016). Humans play the ecological role of ‘su- per predators’ in many systems and can shift the behaviour of even the highest trophic level species (Darimontet al. 2015), triggering fear effects that can differ from and exceed those of natural predators (Proffittet al. 2009; Ciutiet al. 2012; Clin- chyet al. 2016). Humans can also indirectly affect a prey’s perception of risk by modifying the populations of their natu- ral predators, either increasing or decreasing risk of predation. For example exploitation and habitat conversion have led to global predator losses (Esteset al. 2011), whereas predator restoration programmes [e.g.Canis lupus(gray wolves) in Yel- lowstone (Ripple & Beschta 2004)] and human-facilitated invasive species [e.g.Carcinus maenas(green crabs; Bertness & Coverdale 2013)] have increased predator abundances in some systems. Risk assessments and associated behavioural responses can change dramatically as a result of these human- induced changes in predator densities (Ripple & Beschta 2003; Madinet al. 2010). Top-down effects may be particularly ",

INTRODUCTION Foundation species have garnered considerable atten- tion by ecologists over the years for their disproportion- ate role in providing habitat for other species and structuring the communities they live in (Dayton 1972, Ellison et al. 2005). Much of the research on this topic has focused on the capacity of foundation species to influence communities by reducing environmental stress and increasing resource availability and habitat complex- ity (Bertness and Bruno 2001, Angelini et al. 2011, Kik- vidze et al. 2015). By contrast, the effects of foundation species on the stability of their associated communities has received relatively little attention (Bulleri et al. 2012), despite the fact that community stability was cen- tral to the original definition of foundation species (Day- ton 1972). This may be due in part to a traditional focus on long-lived foundation species that vary little in abun- dance or biomass from year to year (e.g., trees, desert shrubs; Ellison et al. 2005, Lindbladh and Foster 2010, Peters and Yao 2012). However, many structure-forming foundation species (e.g., bivalves, grasses, kelps) have rel- atively short life spans (i.e.,<10 yr) or display substan- tial intra-annual variability in abundance or biomass (Altieri and Witman 2006, Rodhouse et al. 2014, Miller et al. 2018). In ecological systems defined by such dynamic foundation species, it has not yet been estab- lished whether the stability of the foundation species enhances the stability of the entire community of organ- isms. Resolving this research gap will help determine the Manuscript received 23 April 2019; revised 27 November 2019; accepted 20 December 2019. Corresponding Editor: Michael H.

The stability of natural communities, and its relation- ship to species richness in particular, has captured the attention of ecologists for decades, spawning consider- able debate about the direction and strength of the rela- tionship between diversity and stability (MacArthur 1955, Goodman 1975, McNaughton 1977, McCann 2000, Ives and Carpenter 2007). Theory predicts that diversity enhances the stability of aggregate community properties (e.g., total biomass, primary production) via a variety of mechanisms, most notably compensatory dynamics, overyielding, evenness, and statistical averag- ing (Doak et al. 1998, Tilman 1999, Yachi and Loreau 1999, Lehman and Tilman 2000, Loreau and de Mazan- court 2008, Thibaut and Connolly 2013). A large num- ber of experimental studies, primarily conducted in grasslands and aquatic mesocosms, have confirmed that species richness can promote community stability and lead to positive diversity–stability relationships (DSR; Tilman and Downing 1994, Tilman 1999, Tilman et al. 2006, Isbell et al. 2009, Hector et al. 2010, Cardinale et al. 2013). However, more recent results derived from field studies in a wide range of natural systems are less definitive regarding the importance of diversity in stabi- lizing communities (Campbell et al. 2011, Houlahan et al. 2018), as compelling evidence for a positive DSR was found in approximately half of the natural commu- nities examined in a recent meta-analysis across multiple ecosystems and taxa (Houlahan et al. 2018). It has been argued that abiotic factors make compensatory dynam- ics rare in nature, which might disrupt DSRs (Houlahan et al. 2007). Consequently, accounting for the abiotic factors known to influence the diversity and abundance of organisms is key to understanding the relationship between diversity and stability in natural systems. The stability of a foundation species may promote community stability by either enhancing species richness, altering the population dynamics of individual species, or both. The stabilizing path involving species richness is supported in part by observations of increased diversity in the presence of foundation species (Kikvidze et al. 2015, Miller et al. 2018). Other lines of evidence show that foundation species reduce abiotic stress (Kikvidze et al. 2015), alter resources (Castorani et al. 2018), pro- vide refuge from predators and competitors (Dayton 1975, Stachowicz 2001, Canion and Heck 2009), and provide nursery habitat (Heck et al. 2003) for many spe- cies. Thus, foundation species have the capacity to pro- mote community stability by directly enhancing the stability of individual species and the degree of asyn- chronous fluctuations among them. The synthetic framework developed by Thibaut and Connolly (2013) has considerable merit for exploring the effects of foundation species on community stability as it explicitly links community stability to population stabil- ity and clarifies their dependency on species richness. Importantly, Thibaut and Connolly showed that com- munity stability is the product of two quantities: (1) the weighted average stability of the populations of the com- munity’s constituent species, and (2) the amount of asynchrony in the temporal fluctuations of these species (i.e., species asynchrony). This framework is particularly useful for investigating DSRs, as it is robust to idiosyn- cratic changes in species’mean abundances, variances, and covariances with increasing diversity that typically occur in nature. In this study, we used the Thibaut and Connolly framework to explore the bounds of DSRs in nature and the role of foundation species in underpinning them. We focused on a taxonomically and phylogenetically diverse assemblage of primary space holders (understory algae and sessile suspension-feeding invertebrates) on temper- ate rocky reefs that thrive beneath the canopy of the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), an iconic foundation species (Graham 2004, Castorani et al. 2018, Miller et al. 2018). We hypothesized that aggregate community biomass should be more stable on reefs where giant kelp biomass is also more stable. To test this hypothesis we surveyed the biomass of both the giant kelp and its asso- ciate assemblage of understory algae and sessile inverte- brates over 18 yr across 32 plots to examine (1) how the stability of the benthic community relates to its species richness (DSR), (2) how species richness relates to spe- cies stability and asynchrony to determine community stability, and (3) how the stability of the dynamic foun- dation species relates to the overall stability of the com- munity through its relationships with species richness and species dynamics. Because environmental hetero- geneity can alter or modulate these relationships (Houla- han et al. 2007) we accounted for a suite of environmental variables known to influence the abun- dance and species composition of reef organisms in our analyses. We also evaluated the contribution of individ- ual species to communi",

Ecological Applications 00(00):e02051. 10.1002/eap.2051 Abstract.Unanticipated declines among exploited species have commonly occurred despite harvests that appeared sustainable prior to collapse. This is particularly true in the oceans where spatial scales of management are often mismatched with spatially complex metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences, and potential solutions for spatial mis- matches in harvested metapopulations in three ways. First, we generate novel theory illustrat- ing when and how harvesting metapopulations increases spatial variability and in turn masks local-scale volatility. Second, we illustrate why spatial variability in harvested metapopulations leads to negative consequences using an empirical example of a Pacific herring metapopula- tion. Finally, we construct a numerical management strategy evaluation model to identify and highlight potential solutions for mismatches in spatial scale and spatial variability. Our results highlight that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales, however, ignoring spatial complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences for people and animals that interact with resources at small scales. Harvesting metapopulations magnifies spatial variability, which creates discrepancies between regional and local trends while increasing risk of local popula- tion collapses. Such effects asymmetrically impact locally constrained fishers and predators, which are more exposed to risks of localized collapses. Importantly, we show that dynamically optimizing harvest can minimize local risk without sacrificing yield. Thus, multiple nested scales of management may be necessary to avoid cryptic collapses in metapopulations and the ensuing ecological, social, and economic consequences.

INTRODUCTION Mismatches in spatial scale create pervasive problems in ecology and natural resource management (Cumming et al. 2006, Cope and Punt 2011). This problem occurs in part because the spatial extent of management or con- servation units is often defined by history, jurisdictional, or institutional criteria rather than the scale of social and ecological processes at play (Levin 1992, Chesson 1998, Cumming et al. 2006). Such choices concerning the scale of management can result in spatial mis- matches, where feedbacks controlling interactions among groups occur at different scales. In managed ecosystems like forestry and fisheries, mismatches may occur when harvest recommendations are based on trends in large-scale abundance without accounting for localized collapses (Johnson et al. 2012) or spatial varia- tion in population structure and harvest rates (Cope and Punt 2011). Yet these spatially isolated collapses can have far-reaching consequences when the species play an indispensable role in local social-ecological systems, including human communities with limited capacity to forage over wide geographic scales. Empirical identifica- tion of appropriate spatial scales of management remains difficult for spatially structured populations, but can be a prerequisite for diagnosing and reconciling challenges that spatial mismatches impose on the sus- tainable and equitable use of natural resources.

A combination of movement, shared climate drivers, and compensatory processes determine whether dynam- ics of individual populations reflect the dynamics of the aggregate metapopulation (Kendall et al. 2000). Consid- eration of metapopulation structure has improved the management of the Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis; Lande 1988), salmon (Onchorhyncusspp.; Stephenson 1999, Rieman and Dunham 2000, Schtickzelle and Quinn 2007, Peterson et al. 2014), amphibians (Marsh and Trenham 2001), and mosquitoes (Adams and Kapan 2009). To date, efforts to integrate metapopula- tion dynamics into natural resource management have largely focused on either minimizing the risk of localized extinction (Chad   es et al. 2011), characterizing produc- tivity of the metapopulation as a whole (sensu Takashina and Mougi 2015), or valuing benefits of portfolio effects (i.e., stabilizing effects of spatial asynchrony sensu Schindler et al. 2010). Less understood, both in theory and in practice, is if and when harvesting metapopula- tions can increase spatial variability that yields mis- matches in spatial scales of management and population dynamics. In this study, we assess how harvest dynamics interact with animal movement and recruitment to shape spatial population variability and risk of collapse at different spatial scales. Our results illustrate the challenge in managing spatially complex populations using three complementary approaches. First, we develop new the- ory using a stochastic analytical model to examine when and how harvesting in a metapopulation amplifies spa- tial variability that can create mismatches in spatial scale. Second, we contextualize the problem of spatial variability and mismatches in spatial scale by presenting historical analyses from spatial Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) fisheries in British Columbia, Canada and home ranges of associated predators and fishers that may be impacted by localized collapses. Finally, we evaluate how and when different harvest management approaches can ameliorate such mismatches using a numerical risk analysis in Pacific herring fisheries. Pacific herring case study in British Columbia’s central coast Pacific herring exemplify the challenges inherent to managing metapopulations that exhibit spatial variation in population trends. In British Columbia (BC), Canada, herring return annually to nearshore coastlines in the late winter/early spring to reproduce. During this annual migration, they are harvested and preyed upon by a range of consumers. Mobile commercial fishing fleets harvest adult herring, largely for their roe, in the days prior to spawning. In contrast, Indigenous fishers are constrained to a local area and largely harvest eggs after spawning events (though some adults as well) as an important food, trade, and cultural resource (Lepofsky and Caldwell 2013, McKechnie et al. 2014, Department of Fisheries and Oceans 2015, von der Porten et al. 2016, Okamoto et al. 2020). These activities create trade-offs among commercial roe fisheries that remove spawning adults, which truncates adult age structure and reduces abundance, vs. those that remove only eggs from shorelines (Shelton et al. 2014). Unfortunately, a core uncertainty for herring management, as for many spe- cies, is the extent of movement between areas (Flostrand et al. 2009, Benson et al. 2015, Jones et al. 2017, Levin et al. 2016). Similar uncertainty surrounds spatial varia- tion in spawning biomass (Siple and Francis 2016), which may result in part from the degree of demographic synchrony between areas (e.g., synchrony in recruit- ment). Pacific herring in British Columbia are currently managed as stocks at regional scales (hundreds of kilo- meters) by Canada’s federal fisheries agency. Within these stocks, multiple spawning aggregations (substocks) seasonally occupy individual stretches of coastline, many of which are of important traditional and cultural value to Indigenous groups. Thus, Pacific herring fisheries pre- sent a valuable system in which to explore how spatial population dynamics, scales of management, and spatial constraints of fishers and predators interact to influence differential risk exposure to population collapses. M ETHODS Methodological overview We used three distinct modeling approaches in this study to explore how harvest can affect spatial dynamics in metapopulations. In Model 1, we developed a novel analytical approach to modeling stochastic age-struc- tured metapopulations to illustrate how and when har- vest can interact with migration and both the magnitude and spatial synchrony of environmental stochasticity. We illustrated these important interactions using this model because of its simplicity and interpretability relative to more complicated nonlinear numerical models. In Model 2, we analy",

KEYWORDS aquaculture, blue economy, climate, Green New Deal, oceans, offshore wind, policy integration, restora- tion, sustainable transportation, Teal Deal 1INTRODUCTION Scientific consensus is clear that bold, coordinated policies are needed to avert present and escalating climate crises. In the United States (U.S.), there is renewed attention to poli- cies that align climate change mitigation and adaptation with economic investments and social equity, often referred to as a Green New Deal. While no detailed policy has been proposed, nascent policy descriptions, articulated primarily in the con- text of 2020 presidential elections, focus largely on investment in terrestrial strategies. Recent international reports (IPCC 2019; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019) have begun to explore the importance of oceans in addressing climate change, sig- nifying an important shift from viewing oceans as climate change aggressors (e.g., sea level rise) or victims (e.g., coral reef decline) to recognize oceans as an integral part of climate solutions. The foundation for this shift is well-established; a rich body of ocean science has demonstrated the criti- cal roles that oceans play in climate mitigation, adaptation, resilience (Galland, Harrould-Kolieb, & Herr 2012), and sus- tainable economic development (Neumann, Ott, & Kenching- ton 2017). Yet high-level policy documents do not provide a blueprint to what changes can be made in the short-term to affect meaningful action towards an integrated terrestrial- ocean framework for climate resilience and adaptation. Here, we articulate the ecological, social and economic potential of investing in integrated terrestrial-ocean climate solutions and identify the specific steps needed to promote more compre- hensive and integrated climate policies that leverage contem- porary ocean science. 2REFRAMING POLICIES TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE Recent national (U.S. HR 109, UK Climate Change Act) and subnational (Washington S.B. 5116, Oregon H.B. 2020, City of Los Angeles) policy proposals to tackle climate change have focused primarily on four policy areas - renewable energy generation, fuel efficiency in transportation systems, food security, and habitat restoration to increase carbon stor- age - all of which have proven capacity to achieve climate goals and promote economic growth. The oceans, however, are largely absent or separate from these proposals, despite recent discourse in environmental news media and increasing global attention to narratives of the blue economy. 1 The con- cept of a Blue New Deal, raised in a televised town hall on cli- mate change with U.S. presidential candidates in September 2019, has received considerably less policy attention. Given the important role that oceans play in regulating climate, and the magnitude of the challenge of addressing climate change, a policy path that integrates both terrestrial and ocean solu- tions, which we refer to here as a Teal Deal, can catalyze cost-effective investments in carbon mitigation, sustainable food systems, and ecosystem restoration. Investing in oceans can strategically complement terrestrial mitigation efforts as part of climate policies to reduce carbon and other green- house gas (GHG) emissions while catalyzing economic devel- opment and social progress. Expanding climate policy frameworks to integrate ocean- based solutions has robust theoretical support. In any pol- icy context, portfolio theory (Markowitz 1952) suggests that by diversifying the potential solution set, risk is reduced and returns on investment increased. In this case, the goal is to identify combinations of terrestrial and marine investments that hedge against risks and maximize societal benefits from climate policies. Given both expected and unanticipated con- sequences of climate change, a portfolio approach increases flexibility and enables decision-makers to use policies that are sufficiently nimble to adapt to rapid changes. The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment specifically flags the impor- tance of planning for uncertain risks from climate change, stating that “risks to interdependent systems” require a multi- sectoral approach (USGCRP 2018). In this context, a portfo- lio approach means shifting proposed climate change policies from a Green or Blue New Deal to a Teal Deal, one that com- bines terrestrial and ocean-based climate solutions. A Teal Deal is likely to hold greater potential for achieving climate regulation goals while also building resilience to risks, gener- ating co-benefits from increased economic development and human well-being, and supporting valuable ecosystem ser- vices. Here, we present a blueprint for action in four specific sectors—renewable energy, transportation, food security, and habitat restoration—elaborating on ocean-based approaches 1 MongaBay March 13, 2019; Grist July 15,2019; Data for Progress Septem- ber 3, 2019; The Hill September 9, 2019.

Conservationists seeking to minimize region‐wide variability in resources and reduce extinction risk often seek to preserve a metapopulation portfolio of spatially asynchronous subpopulations connected by dispersal. However, portfolio properties are not necessarily static, and the erosion of a portfolio can fundamentally alter the population dynamics and services a species provides. In the Northeast Pacific, a portfolio of spatially asynchronous herring populations has historically provided regional reliability of herring to mobile predators and commercial fishermen as well as local subsistence and ceremonial harvest. Here, we fit a mechanistic time‐series model to herring spawn and catch records from 1950 to 2015 to quantify how population growth, climate, and fishing have contributed to a major shift in the herring portfolio over time. We document the erosion of the herring portfolio and a severe decline in herring population growth. Commercial harvest historically played a key role in herring dynamics, hovering around typical annual exploitation rates (15%) at the archipelago scale, but local harvest rates were much higher when fishing occurred (as high as 65%). Additionally, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and population growth had equally strong effects on local and regional herring population dynamics. Our results highlight how spatially structured populations can undergo major shifts following disturbance and emphasize how ecological systems do not always rapidly recover and provide services following disturbance. Developing herring management strategies at a finer scale may ensure greater regional resource reliability by recovering previous levels of spatial population asynchrony. However, doing so may require higher implementation and monitoring costs in order to yield higher ecological, social, and economic benefits. Such place‐based solutions that match the spatial scale of governance to the spatial scale of ecological dynamics have the potential to improve future management and conservation in an increasingly dynamic world.",

E-mail:astier@ucsb.edu vwww.esajournals.org1November 2020vVolume 11(11)vArticle e03283 INTRODUCTION Spatial asynchrony of population abundance and demographic rates is common in numerous taxa, including insects (Ehrlich et al. 1975), plants (Waddle et al. 2019), birds (Ringsby et al. 2002), andfishes (Hilborn et al. 2003). Ecologists and conservation biologists have been increasingly interested in the existence of asynchrony among subpopulations connected through dispersal because it is directly related to metapopulation viability. When populations are connected and highly asynchronous, extinction risk is reduced because abundant subpopulations can re-estab- lish those that have been extirpated (i.e., a rescue effect; Hill et al. 2002). As a corollary, syn- chronous subpopulations lead to higher likeli- hood of metapopulation extinction. Therefore, understanding the degree of population asyn- chrony in wild populations, as well as drivers and patterns of shifts in asynchrony through time, is key to the conservation and management of metapopulations. Underlying drivers of population asynchrony include genetic or ecological differences in popu- lations across space, spatio-temporal variability in breeding habitat availability, and life-history diversity linked to local environmental drivers. For example, asynchrony across house sparrow populations is driven by local weather conditions that cause variable breeding timing (Ringsby et al. 2002). Similarly, in Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), spatially asynchronous populations emerge from covariance between life-history diversity (e.g., spawn timing, morphology, egg size, and time spent in sea vs. freshwater) and local envi- ronmental variability. The resulting asynchronous populationfluctuations generate a population portfolio (similar tofinancial portfolios; Markow- itz 1952), which reduces extinction risk by increas- ing regional metapopulation stability (Hanski 1998, Leibold et al. 2004, Schindler et al. 2015) and thereby increases the reliability of resources to humans (Nesbitt and Moore 2016) and other predators in the ecosystem (Armstrong et al. 2016). Importantly, asynchrony is not afixed, time-in- variant attribute of systems. Human impacts, eco- logical changes, or environmental shifts can decrease spatial asynchrony (Liebhold et al. 2004). This decreased asynchrony can reduce the viability of the metapopulation and associated ecosystem services. For example, an increase in predators or large-scale environmental impacts can synchronize highly asynchronous populations (Liebhold et al. 2004). Reduced population asyn- chrony can alter provisioning of cultural and ecosystem services (Luck et al. 2003). In sockeye salmon (O. nerka), spatial asynchrony halves vari- ability in annual biomass (Schindler et al. 2010). Increased resource reliability lowers the probabil- ity of salmonfisheries closures (Schindler et al. 2010) and is beneficial to mobile predators and riparian ecosystems that are dependent on salmon (Ruff et al. 2011). Consequently, a reduction in the portfolio generated by lower asynchrony can have deleterious effects on the ecological roles and ser- vices provided by a species. Identifying the ecological and environmental drivers of population asynchrony may have important conservation and restoration implica- tions. For example, when a population collapses, identifying which subpopulations might be tar- geted for restoration to promote population diversity may facilitate regional recovery and system-wide buffering capacity. Here, we explore changes in spatial asynchrony in Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), a species known for boom and bust cycles, important prey for a range of top predators, and the focus of both industrial and indigenousfisheries (Siple and Francis 2015). We make use of a 65-year (1950–2015) spatially expli- cit data set in Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada, and use it tofit a metapopulation model for 11 local subpopulations of Pacific herring. This approach allows us to ask: 1. What are the relative roles of population growth, climate, andfishing in driving changes in local and regional herring popu- lations? 2. How have local and regional herring popu- lations changed over time? 3. How have patterns of spatial asynchrony in local herring populations changed over time? METHODS Study species and system Pacific herring are an ecologically, commer- cially, and culturally valuablefish of the North vwww.esajournals.org2November 2020vVolume 11(11)vArticle e03283 COASTAL AND MARINE ECOLOGYSTIER ET AL. Pacific (Levin et al. 2016) and are a useful model for examining the causes and consequences of population asynchrony in wild populations. Abi- otic and biotic forcing at both local and regional scales drive Pacific herring life-history and popu- lation structure (REF), which likely shape popu- lation dynamics. Herring recruit to the spawning population at age 3. At age 3 and older (Hay 1985), spawning adults annually migrate from the pelagic environment to inshore habitats to spawn in particular bays along the coast (Flos- trand et al. 2009), where they deposit their eggs on shallow subtidal habitats vegetated with algae and eelgrass,Zostera marina(Shelton et al. 2014). Larger juvenile herring migrate to deeper waters and individuals from multiple locations are thought to intermix in the coastal ocean, where they experience similar environmental conditions. After maturing, reproductive herring return to spawning beaches and the process repeats. Thus, herring life-history provides the potential to reflect both unique and shared com- ponents that may synchronize or desynchronize local populations. Pacific herring maintain a central node within Northeast Pacific food webs, support top preda- tors (Surma and Pitcher 2015), and are a cultural keystone species for indigenous peoples (Thorn- ton and Kitka 2015). They occur throughout the North Pacific, from the Yellow Sea to coastal Cal- ifornia (Love 1996), and local and regional oceanographic conditions have been linked to Pacific herring growth and recruitment (Sch- weigert et al. 2010). We focus on herring populations of Haida Gwaii, a remote 300 km long archipelago of~150 islands (~10,000 km 2 land area) located at the edge of the continental shelf, 70 km off the north coast of British Columbia, Canada, with a",

Keywords: likelihood, evidence functions, SIC, standard metabolic rate, mixed effects models, metabolic scaling, evidentialist statistics INTRODUCTION One of most contentious controversies in ecology is the scaling relationship between an organism’s body mass and metabolic rate (Agutter and Wheatley, 2004; Isaac and Carbone, 2010; Glazier, 2018). Kleiber (1932) popularized the idea that contrary to a century of theory, a mammal’s metabolic rate (MR) scales with body mass (BM) not as a power law with an exponent ofβ= 0.67, but as a power law with an exponent ofβ= 0.75. This relationship takes the form ln(MR)=β×ln(BM)+c(1) whereβis the scaling relationship andcis an intercept from a liner regression. As a cornerstone of the metabolic theory of ecology (Brown et al., 2004), this 0.75 scaling relationship is used to link Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org1September 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1166 fphys-10-01166September 19, 2019Time: 10:16# 2 Jerde et al.Evidentialist Metabolic Scaling individual physiology to the observed patterns of communities and energy flows across landscapes. The 0.75 value has been mechanistically justified through hypotheses that maximize energy delivery to tissue in animals (West et al., 1997) and from xylem and phloem networks that transport water and nutrients in plants (Enquist and Niklas, 2001). However, the universality of the 0.75 value is eagerly disputed, with alternative hypotheses and empirical studies putting the scaling relationship commonly between 0.5 and 1 (Bokma, 2004; Glazier, 2018). Intraspecific (within species) scaling has been proposed to differ from interspecific (between species) scaling and also different mechanisms may be responsible for different scaling relationships. Metabolic rates vary 2–3 fold across individuals of the same population and this variation is repeatable (Burton et al., 2011; Norin and Malte, 2011; Boldsen et al., 2013). Intraspecific scaling has received less attention than interspecific scaling, while even fewer studies have investigated scaling relationships within each tested individual as it grows (but see Norin and Gamperl, 2018). Both intraspecific and interspecific scaling are critical for linking species physiology to projections of population abundance (Kooijman, 1993) and predicting the impacts of climate change on species distributions (Sunday et al., 2010; Lindmark et al., 2018). While the implications of deviations from the 0.75 scaling exponent are large, there is limited data available to accurately estimate the exponent. This is because measuring the metabolic rate of an individual is not a trivial experiment, let alone across a 10-fold range of body sizes from a population, at different temperatures, and/or across species (Lighton, 2018). To date, most studies have relied on either a limited study design (one species, many individuals, with fixed treatments of temperature; Table 1) or meta-analysis of mean metabolic rate data across studies using variable methods of measurement (Glazier, 2005). While the former can suffer from insufficient sample sizes, measurement error, and unaccounted for factors influencing the general relationship, the latter treats all studies equally and both approaches have ultimately been inconclusive as to the evidence supporting or refuting competing hypotheses (Glazier, 2018) with some concluding there is not a universal scaling constant (Bokma, 2004). In thisFrontiersResearch Topic devoted to evidential statistics, model identification, and science, multiple contri- butions (Dennis et al., 2019) show how standard statistical approaches (such as Fisherian significant tests, Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing, Akaike Information Criterion for multi- model inference) are misleading when models used for inference are misspecified. Model misspecification is arguably the case for most analyses, including ours, that seek to evaluate the evidence of a universal scaling relationship across a broad range of fish species, at different temperatures, and using studies, that have reliable data, but that were not necessarily designed to have a large range of body masses across which to regress metabolic rate. Here we demonstrate how an evidentialist approach can be applied to gain novel insight to the question, “What is the evidence for an intraspecific universal scaling relationship between fish body mass and metabolic rate?” Scaling Relationships as Hypotheses for Fish Multiple mechanisms have been put forth to justifyβ= 0.67, 0.75, and 1 scaling relationships. If the primary limitation for resources or waste removal is transport of chemicals across surfaces, then metabolic rate is predicted to scale with surface area with a relationship of 0.67. For example, Killen et al. (2010) found that highly active, pelagic fishes had a scaling relationship of 0.7 (SE 0.04), close to 0.67, which they attributed to a constraint in oxygen or fuel acquisition or waste removal across surface areas in these metabolically active fishes. However, the 0.67 scaling exponent is more commonly found in endotherms, mammals and birds, but rarely in ectotherms (White and Seymour, 2003; White et al., 2005). If metabolic rate is primarily limited by the fractal nature of distribution networks (e.g., the internal transport networks of resources and wastes), then a scaling relationship of 0.75 is predicted (West et al., 1997). Previous synthesis of teleost fish found a scaling relationship of 0.79 (SE 0.11) (Clarke and Johnston, 1999), and with sufficient variability as to not exclude the 0.75 value used by Metabolic Theory of Ecology to explain broad ecological patterns (Brown et al., 2004). Similarly, Moses et al. (2008) showed metabolic scaling during ontogeny for seven fish species was 0.78 (SE 0.02), with some variability in slope estimates between species. Metabolic rate is predicted to be directly proportional to body size (i.e.,β= 1) when maintenance and routine activity costs are low and these demands can easily be met by both surface area and internal transport mechanisms. In the case of less active fish or those occupying deeper waters, individual metabolism has been demonstrated to scale nearly proportionally to body mass [i.e., scaling exponents approach 1 (Killen et al., 2010)]. Two more recent hypotheses work with the common observation that scaling exponents vary (e.g., Glazier, 2018). The metabolic-level boundaries (MLB) hypothesis of scaling (Glazier, 2008) states that any observed scaling exponent varies within the limits of 0.67 and 1, representing whether the mechanisms or processes that underlay the scaling relationship are predominantly limited by surface area constraints on fluxes of resources, waste and heat (0.67; e.g., gill surface area, internal transport limitation) or by volume (mass) constraints on energy demand or production of tissue (1; assuming energy demand is proportional to tissue size). Therefore, MLB also provides an explanation to variable scaling exponents of animals at different physiological states, or routine requirements. Alternatively, Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory (Kooijman, 1993) provide",

    "abstract": "Understanding the threats to global biodiversity and ecosystem services posed by human impacts on coastal and marine environments requires the establishment and maintenance of ecological observatories that integrate the biological, physical, geological and biogeochemical aspects of ecosystems. This is crucial to provide scientists and stakeholders with the support and knowledge necessary to quantify environmental change and its impact on the sustainable use of the seas and coasts. In this paper, we explore the potential for the coastal and marine components of the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network (ILTER) to fill this need for integrated global observation, and highlight how ecological observations are necessary to address the challenges posed by climate change and evolving human needs and stressors within the coastal zone. The ILTER is a global network encompassing 44 countries and 700 research sites in a variety of ecosystems across the planet, more than 100 of which are located in coastal and marine environments (ILTER-CMS). While most (50%) of the ILTER-CMS were established after the year 2000, in some cases they date back to the early 1900s. At ILTER sites a broad variety of abiotic and biotic variables are measured, which may feed into other global initiatives. The ILTER community has produced tools to harmonize and compare measurements and methods, allowing for data integration workflows and analyses between and within individual ILTER sites. After a brief historical overview of ILTER, with emphasis on the marine component, we analyze the potential contribution of the ILTER-CMS to global coastal and ocean observation, adopting the \"Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT)\" approach. We also identify ways in which the in situ parameters collected at ILTER sites currently fit within the Essential Ocean Variables framework (as proposed by the Framework for Ocean Observation recommendations) and provide insights on the use of new technology in long-term studies. Final recommendations point at the need to further develop observational activities at LTER sites and improve coordination among them and with external related initiatives in order to maximise their exploitation and address present and future challenges in ocean observations.",

This is crucial to provide scientists and stakeholders with the support and knowledge necessary to quantify environmental change and its impact on the sustainable use of the seas and coasts. In this paper, we explore the potential for the coastal and marine components of the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network (ILTER) to fill this need for integrated global observation, and highlight how ecological observations are necessary to address the challenges posed by climate change and evolving human needs and stressors within the coastal zone. The ILTER is a global network encompassing 44 countries and 700 research sites in a variety of ecosystems across the planet, more than 100 of which are located in coastal and marine environments (ILTER-CMS). While most of the ILTER-CMS were established after the year 2000, in some cases they date back to the early 1900s. At ILTER sites, a broad variety of abiotic and biotic variables Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org1August 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 527 fmars-06-00527August 27, 2019Time: 17:48# 2 Muelbert et al.ILTER for Coastal and Ocean Observations are measured, which may feed into other global initiatives. The ILTER community has produced tools to harmonize and compare measurements and methods, allowing for data integration workflows and analyses between and within individual ILTER sites. After a brief historical overview of ILTER, with emphasis on the marine component, we analyze the potential contribution of the ILTER-CMS to global coastal and ocean observation, adopting the “Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT)” approach. We also identify ways in which thein situparameters collected at ILTER sites currently fit within the Essential Ocean Variables framework (as proposed by the Framework for Ocean Observation recommendations) and provide insights on the use of new technology in long-term studies. Final recommendations point at the need to further develop observational activities at LTER sites and improve coordination among them and with external related initiatives in order to maximize their exploitation and address present and future challenges in ocean observations. Keywords: climate change, marine ecosystems, ecology, EOVs, SWOT, DEIMS INTRODUCTION Human activities threaten both the natural functioning of coastal and marine ecosystems and their sustainable use by present and future generations (Worm et al., 2006; Defeo et al., 2009; Halpern et al., 2012; Howes et al., 2015; Drius et al., 2016; Malavasi et al., 2018). Developing and delivering the ecological knowledge necessary to quantify how threats to coastal ecosystems impact national and international economies, policies and the sustainable use of the sea poses a significant challenge. Gaining such ecological knowledge on a local scale requires long-term observations of both environmental and biological variables, such as temperature and species richness. Effective assessment, management and prediction at the global scale, however, requires infrastructure and ecological observatories capable of systematically integrating from a long-term, large-scale, and whole-system perspective. Developing new observing systems and strengthening existing initiatives in a coordinated, standardized, global effort is essential to address these challenges. Marine observatories provide the infrastructure and logistical support necessary to acquire data and knowledge for these purposes. The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS 1 ) was established to provide a sustained, collaborative system for ocean observation that brings togetherin situnetworks, remote sensing systems, government stakeholders, UN agencies and individual scientists. An important outcome of OceanObs’09 was the recognition of an imbalance between physical and biogeochemical/biological/ecological observations within most observing systems and the recommendation that GOOS consider how to expand the scope of observations to best address socially pressing global issues, including food security, harmful algal blooms, the spread of dead zones, and biodiversity conservation (Lindstrom et al., 2012). To that end, GOOS has established Biology and Ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs 2 , 1 http://goosocean.org/ 2 http://www.goosocean.org/eov Miloslavich et al., 2018). The International Long-Term Ecological Research Network (ILTER 3 ) is uniquely poised to contribute to the need for integrated, global observation of biological and ecological aspects of coastal ecosystems. Focal areas of the ILTER coastal and marine sites (henceforth ILTER-CMS) include: the consequences of biodiversity alteration for ecosystem functioning and services, documenting productivity changes, and understanding the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors including overfishing and ocean acidification. In this paper we explore the coastal and marine component of ILTER as a platform for global coastal and ocean observation, highlighting the role of ecological observations to address the challenges posed by climate change and evolving human needs and stressors within the coastal zone. To begin, we provide a brief historical overview of ILTER and describe its organization, with emphasis on the marine component. Next, we analyze the potential contribution of the ILTER marine component to global coastal and ocean observation adopting the “Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT)” approach. From this analysis, we elaborate on two specific opportunities for ILTER-CMS to contribute to global ocean observing. One, we identify ways that the in situparameters collected at ILTER sites fit within the EOVs framework, as proposed by the “Framework for Ocean Observation” (FOO, Lindstrom et al., 2012) recommendations, and, two, provide insights on the use of new technology in long-term studies. Finally, we recommend paths forward to address future challenges.

Such policies will mitigate conflicts between recovery objectives at different spatial scales and better integrate local knowledge and traditional cultural practices around recovery. OUTLOOK:Application of these principles will help to reshape recovery of marine ecosys- tems, yet important scientific questions and societal barriers remain. For researchers, inter- actions among multiple components of environ- mental change will test the limits of prediction in tomorrow’s ocean. For managers and policy- makers, operationalizing an inclusive definition of recovery organized around social-ecological resilience will prove more challenging than simply recrafting recovery policies with new recovery metrics. Rather, this process will involve designing policies that align incentives for disparate human actors toward coherent re- covery goals. Looking ahead, emerging technolo- gies can enable interventions necessary to match the scale of the challenge. It remains possible to recover lost biodiversity in the ocean and to en- hance the delivery of marine ecosystem services. Doing so will require a strategic, nuanced, and flexible conceptualization of ocean recoveries that can keep pace with ever-changing physical, eco- logical, and social environments. ▪ RESEARCH Ingemanet al.,Science363, 363 (2019)25 January 20191of1 Environmental shifts create moving targets for marine recoveries.(AtoD) Since the end of whaling (1), North Atlantic right whales have experienced steady recovery, fueled by abundant copepod prey (2) and aided by vessel speed restrictions and routing human activities away from sensitive habitats (3). Rapid warming has caused reproductive failure by reducing the availability of copepods (4). In 2017, whales followed prey into areas where effective vessel avoidance measures were not in place, substantially increasing mortality from collisions and entanglement (5). Extending vessel restrictions may be effective in reducing mortality. Looking ahead,“rope-less”fishing gear (6) and real-time data sharing (7) offer hope for resuming recovery. Reduced productivity and increased mortality may necessitate recalibrating recovery timelines (8) compared to original projections (9).

Ingeman 1 *, Jameal F. Samhouri 2 , Adrian C. Stier 1 * Growing scientific awareness, strong regulations, and effective management have begun to fulfill the promise of recovery in the ocean. However, many efforts toward ocean recovery remain unsuccessful, in part because marine ecosystems and the human societies that depend upon them are constantly changing. Furthermore, recovery efforts are embedded in marine social-ecological systems where large-scale dynamics can inhibit recovery. We argue that the ways forward are to (i) rethink an inclusive definition of recovery that embraces a diversity of stakeholder perspectives about acceptable recovery goals and ecosystem outcomes; (ii) encourage research that enables anticipation of feasible recovery states and identifies pathways toward resilient ecosystems; and (iii) adopt policies that are sufficiently nimble to keep pace with rapid change and governance that works seamlessly from local to regional scales. Application of these principles can facilitate successful recoveries in a world where environmental conditions and social imperatives are constantly shifting. B illions of people depend upon the ocean for food, livelihoods, energy production, and trade. Although humans have used ocean resources for millennia, the increas- ing scale and scope of human activity (1) have radically transformed the biological and physical properties of the ocean (2,3), imperiling ocean ecosystems and the continued delivery of vital marine services (4). Humans living on tomorrow’s Earth will demand even more from the ocean. Navigating a pathway toward a pros- perous and sustainable future depends on re- covering degraded populations and ecosystems and harnessing the intrinsic and instrumental benefits the ocean can provide. In recent years, growing scientific awareness, strong regulations, and increasingly sophisticated management have begun to fulfill the promise of ocean recoveries; familiar examples include the rebuilding of fisheries, recovery of taxa pro- tected by threatened and endangered species laws (5), and restoration of important marine habitats (6). However, many marine recovery efforts have failed to reach their objectives,even after decades of active intervention (7,8). In other cases, recovery of depleted populations has sur- passed expectations (though often remaining below historical levels), resulting in the coloni- zation of novel habitats (9) and bringing new conservation conflicts to light (10,11). The inability to simply turn back the clock should come as no surprise given that recovery efforts often fail to consider the complex and adaptive nature of the ocean systems (12). In- deed, the oceans and the social systems that depend upon them are inherently dynamic, and increasingly so in an era of rapid climate change andgloballyconnectedmarkets(13). Moreover, marine social-ecological systems vary across space and comprise diverse stakeholder groups who derive value from different aspects of ma- rine systems. These dynamic environmental, eco- logical, and societal contexts present a shifting landscape for defining and achieving successful ocean recoveries (14). Yet, current conceptions of recovery can be narrow in scope and out of step with rapidly changing environmental conditions, making them insufficient for tomorrow’s ocean with its diversity of intrinsic and anthropocentric val- ues. To effectively reverse marine degradation, we must embrace the dynamic nature of recov- ery targets—and the flexible solutions required to hit these moving targets (Fig. 1). To be clear, this assertion does not imply a lowering of standards or relaxing of mandates for recovery. Rather, it is a call for a broader definition of re- covery that acknowledges that oceans—and the human systems connected to them—are dynam- ic, and which embraces the manifold nature of recovery success. Here, we synthesize how recent scientific ad- vances offer pathways to successfully recovering marine populations and ecosystems in tomor- row’s ocean. We discuss ways that management and policy can promote recovery by becoming more agile and integrated across scales. Finally, we highlight the promise of emerging technology to enable the ambitious interventions necessary to match the challenge of ocean recoveries in an uncertain future. Redefining recovery We define population and ecosystem recovery as a sustained increase in the attributes of the system that provide lasting ecological and social value. At a minimum, recovery entails the return of population viability and ecological function. A “recovered”system will not necessarily remain in stasis, but an important metric of recovery at the ecosystem-level is improved resilience—the abil- ity to resist shifts toward less-functional states ",

Grazing halos—barren areas of sand surrounding coral reefs—are readily visible in remotely sensed imagery, and are formed by herbivores preferentially grazing close to the safety of the reef. Grazing halo size can vary by more than an order of magnitude, yet we lack an understanding of what underlies this variation. Changes in grazing intensity and the distance herbivores travel may be influenced by predation risk, resource availability, and structural attributes of the reef. Here, we tested how predator density, herbivore density, and patch reef area are correlated with halo size and grazing patterns by linking satellite imagery with mensurative experiments on patch reefs in the Caribbean. Chronic predation risk suppressed the overall foraging intensity of herbivorous fishes; a doubling in predator density led to a 29% decrease in grazing. Variation in herbivore density, which was tightly correlated with patch reef area, was linked to the distance herbivores foraged from the reef. Furthermore, herbivore density and/or reef area was the best predictor of halo width at field sites, and reef area explained a significant proportion of the variation in halo size across the landscape. Our results contribute to a growing body of research suggesting that halos may function as footprints of ecological processes, such as herbivory, that can be quantified using remote sensing, and offer a potential avenue to improve monitoring of coral reef management.

This is crucial to provide scientists and stakeholders with the support and knowledge necessary to quantify environmental change and its impact on the sustainable use of the seas and coasts. In this paper, we explore the potential for the coastal and marine components of the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network (ILTER) to fill this need for integrated global observation, and highlight how ecological observations are necessary to address the challenges posed by climate change and evolving human needs and stressors within the coastal zone. The ILTER is a global network encompassing 44 countries and 700 research sites in a variety of ecosystems across the planet, more than 100 of which are located in coastal and marine environments (ILTER-CMS). While most of the ILTER-CMS were established after the year 2000, in some cases they date back to the early 1900s. At ILTER sites, a broad variety of abiotic and biotic variables Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org1August 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 527 fmars-06-00527August 27, 2019Time: 17:48# 2 Muelbert et al.ILTER for Coastal and Ocean Observations are measured, which may feed into other global initiatives. The ILTER community has produced tools to harmonize and compare measurements and methods, allowing for data integration workflows and analyses between and within individual ILTER sites. After a brief historical overview of ILTER, with emphasis on the marine component, we analyze the potential contribution of the ILTER-CMS to global coastal and ocean observation, adopting the “Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT)” approach. We also identify ways in which thein situparameters collected at ILTER sites currently fit within the Essential Ocean Variables framework (as proposed by the Framework for Ocean Observation recommendations) and provide insights on the use of new technology in long-term studies. Final recommendations point at the need to further develop observational activities at LTER sites and improve coordination among them and with external related initiatives in order to maximize their exploitation and address present and future challenges in ocean observations. Keywords: climate change, marine ecosystems, ecology, EOVs, SWOT, DEIMS INTRODUCTION Human activities threaten both the natural functioning of coastal and marine ecosystems and their sustainable use by present and future generations (Worm et al., 2006; Defeo et al., 2009; Halpern et al., 2012; Howes et al., 2015; Drius et al., 2016; Malavasi et al., 2018). Developing and delivering the ecological knowledge necessary to quantify how threats to coastal ecosystems impact national and international economies, policies and the sustainable use of the sea poses a significant challenge. Gaining such ecological knowledge on a local scale requires long-term observations of both environmental and biological variables, such as temperature and species richness. Effective assessment, management and prediction at the global scale, however, requires infrastructure and ecological observatories capable of systematically integrating from a long-term, large-scale, and whole-system perspective. Developing new observing systems and strengthening existing initiatives in a coordinated, standardized, global effort is essential to address these challenges. Marine observatories provide the infrastructure and logistical support necessary to acquire data and knowledge for these purposes. The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS 1 ) was established to provide a sustained, collaborative system for ocean observation that brings togetherin situnetworks, remote sensing systems, government stakeholders, UN agencies and individual scientists. An important outcome of OceanObs’09 was the recognition of an imbalance between physical and biogeochemical/biological/ecological observations within most observing systems and the recommendation that GOOS consider how to expand the scope of observations to best address socially pressing global issues, including food security, harmful algal blooms, the spread of dead zones, and biodiversity conservation (Lindstrom et al., 2012). To that end, GOOS has established Biology and Ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs 2 , 1 http://goosocean.org/ 2 http://www.goosocean.org/eov Miloslavich et al., 2018). The International Long-Term Ecological Research Network (ILTER 3 ) is uniquely poised to contribute to the need for integrated, global observation of biological and ecological aspects of coastal ecosystems. Focal areas of the ILTER coastal and marine sites (henceforth ILTER-CMS) include: the consequences of biodiversity alteration for ecosystem functioning and services, documenting productivity changes, and understanding the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors including overfishing and ocean acidification. In this paper we explore the coastal and marine component of ILTER as a platform for global coastal and ocean observation, highlighting the role of ecological observations to address the challenges posed by climate change and evolving human needs and stressors within the coastal zone. To begin, we provide a brief historical overview of ILTER and describe its organization, with emphasis on the marine component. Next, we analyze the potential contribution of the ILTER marine component to global coastal and ocean observation adopting the “Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT)” approach. From this analysis, we elaborate on two specific opportunities for ILTER-CMS to contribute to global ocean observing. One, we identify ways that the in situparameters collected at ILTER sites fit within the EOVs framework, as proposed by the “Framework for Ocean Observation” (FOO, Lindstrom et al., 2012) recommendations, and, two, provide insights on the use of new technology in long-term studies. Finally, we recommend paths forward to address future challenges.

However, temporal variation in dispersal due to seasonality, weather, and other stochastic forces is an understudied aspect of the dispersal-diversity relationship. Metacommunity theory predicts temporal variation in dispersal can alter species distributions across patches. We empirically tested the hypothesis that variation in dispersal can modify the nonlinear dispersal-diversity relationship. Using a mesocosm experiment, we factorially manipulated variation in and intensity of dispersal in invertebrate grazer communities associated with nearshore seagrass ecosystems. Higher dispersal intensity led to higher grazer abundance, higher species richness (alpha diversity), and—when dispersal was variable—lower compositional similarity among patches (higher beta diversity). Within each dispersal intensity treatment level, temporal variation in dispersal decreased alpha diversity and increased beta diversity, with strongest effects at low- and intermediate-intensity dispersal. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that temporal variation in dispersal can substantially modify the well-described dispersal-diversity relationship for both alpha and beta diversity. Broadly, our results provide increasing evidence for the effects of spatial and temporal variability in modifying the role of the ecological processes driving marine metacommunity structure.

This is crucial to provide scientists and stakeholders with the support and knowledge necessary to quantify environmental change and its impact on the sustainable use of the seas and coasts. In this paper, we explore the potential for the coastal and marine components of the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network (ILTER) to fill this need for integrated global observation, and highlight how ecological observations are necessary to address the challenges posed by climate change and evolving human needs and stressors within the coastal zone. The ILTER is a global network encompassing 44 countries and 700 research sites in a variety of ecosystems across the planet, more than 100 of which are located in coastal and marine environments (ILTER-CMS). While most of the ILTER-CMS were established after the year 2000, in some cases they date back to the early 1900s.

For example, prior studies have shown that larger and faster prey species are more likely to escape predation (Einfalt & Wahl, 1997; Hoyle & Keast, 1987; Werner & Hall, 1974). Likewise, individual variation in pred‐ ator jaw morphology can shape the effect of predators on commu‐ nity composition at both the producer and primary consumer levels (Post, Palkovacs, Schielke, & Dodson, 2008). Parallel lines of evi‐ dence suggest that among individual variation in key traits of both predators and primary producers can affect ecosystem structure and function (Bolnick et al., 2011, 2003; Wolf & Weissing, 2012). For instance, genetic diversity within primary producer species is correlated with consumer diversity and community resilience, seem‐ ingly by increasing the diversity of interaction types (Crutsinger et al., 2006; Hughes & Stachowicz, 2004; Johnson, Lajeunesse, & Agrawal, 2006; Reusch, Ehlers, Hämmerli, & Worm, 2005; Rudman Received: 5 March 2019 | Revised: 19 June 2019 | Accepted: 20 June 2019 DOI: 10.1111/eth.12924 RESEARCH PAPER Predator‐induced selection on urchin activity level depends on urchin body size Justin D.

This is potentially of great interest, because predation by recovering lobster populations could alter the stability of kelp forests by culling specific phenotypes, like foraging phenotypes, from urchin populations. KEYWORDS activity, behavioral type, covering behavior, predation risk, predator–prey interactions, temperament | 717 PRETORIUS ET al. et al., 2015). Understanding how intraspecific variation in morphol‐ ogy and behavior shape the outcome of predator–prey interactions is of specific interest, because these interactions can change con‐ sumer abundance and behavior, and therefore, alter the role of pre‐ dation in driving the stability, function, and resilience of ecosystems (Brown, Laundré, & Gurung, 1999; Miller, Ament, & Schmitz, 2014; Preisser & Bolnick, 2008). The past few decades have seen a rise in the number of stud‐ ies focused on intraspecific behavioral variation (Bell, Hankison, & Laskowski, 2009; Sih, Cote, Evans, Fogarty, & Pruitt, 2012). In particular, much literature has examined the effects of temporally consistent individual differences in behavior, or so‐called “animal personalities” (Carter, Feeney, Marshall, Cowlishaw, & Heinsohn, 2013; Gosling, 2001) and their effect on species interactions (Chang, Teo, Norma‐Rashid, & Li, 2017; Lichtenstein, Wright, McEwen, Pinter‐Wollman, & Pruitt, 2017; Nannini, Parkos, & Wahl, 2012). Animal personalities imply that there exists a level of constraint to the behavioral plasticity individuals display in any given context (Dall, Houston, & McNamara, 2004; Dingemanse, Kazem, Réale, & Wright, 2010; Dochtermann & Dingemanse, 2013), meaning that individuals may exhibit behavioral consistency through time and across con‐ texts, occasionally to their detriment (Jones & Godin, 2010; Pearish, Hostert, & Bell, 2013; Pruitt, Riechert, & Jones, 2008). For instance, some prey animals ceaselessly seek shelter regardless of the con‐ textual risk, which can result in decreased opportunities to forage or mate, while other animals may continuously forage regardless of the level of predation risk (Dall et al., 2004; Wilson, Coleman, Clark, & Biederman, 1993). Yet, the available empirical evidence suggests that the effects of prey behavior on the outcome of predator–prey interactions varies considerably among systems (Belgrad & Griffen, 2016; Keiser, Ingley, Toscano, Scharf, & Pruitt, 2017), and even varies based on the traits of the individuals (predator and prey) involved (DiRienzo, Pruitt, & Hedrick, 2013; McGhee, Pintor, Suhr, & Bell, 2012; Sweeney et al., 2013). Here, we use the purple urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), and the California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus), to evaluate the effect of prey behavioral tendencies and size on prey survival. Urchins are ecologically notable because of their ability to consume large quantities of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and therefore alter the state of coastal kelp communities (Estes & Duggins, 1995; Harrold & Reed, 1985; Pearse, 2006). Across the wide geographic distribution of purple urchins along the west coast of North America (Ebert, 2010), urchins are eaten by a diversity of predatory species including the sunflower sea star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), otters (Enhydra lutris), sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher), and California spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus). These predators can play key roles in regulating herbivory by urchins on giant kelp (Burt et al., 2018; Caselle, Davis, & Marks, 2018). However, the role of variation in urchin size structure and individual behavioral variation in their susceptibility to predation remains mysterious, even though such variation in mortality could explain variation in community suscepti‐ bility to urchin‐driven state shifts, like between kelp forests versus urchin barrens, a process often referred to as a “tipping point” (Pruitt et al., 2018; Selkoe et al., 2015). We focused on how two behavioral traits might determine prey survival in the presence of spiny lob‐ sters: propensity to move (activity level), which can increase or de‐ crease encounter rates with predators (Huey & Pianka, 1981; Skelly, 1994), and urchin's tendency to conceal themselves with substrate (covering behavior). Although the function of urchin covering behav‐ ior appears to vary among species (i.e., protection from wave action; Dumont, Drolet, Deschênes, & Himmelman, 2007), we predicted that urchins would be safer from predators while buried in substrate. We tested the hypothesis that slow‐moving purple urchins and urchins with a greater tendency to cover themselves and/or larger urchins will enjoy greater survival during staged encounters with sit‐and‐pursue predators. The former is predicted by Locomotor Crossover Hypothesis proposed by Huey and Pianka (1981), which posits that predators should tend to encounter and consume prey of the opposing activity level (active predators consume sedentary prey, whereas sit‐and‐pursue predators consume active prey). To probe the role of size, we tested whether urchin size increases urchin survival jointly with urchin behavioral traits. We further evaluated whether prey behavior measured in isolation is correlated with prey behavior during real encounters with predators. Consistency across testing conditions is a commonly untested assumption in animal per‐ sonality studies, usually overlooked because of logistical limitations. However, the conspicuousness of the urchin covering behavior and the slow movements of predator and prey in this study made on‐ going assessment of this behavior achievable. Together, this system allowed us to evaluate how the behavioral and morphological traits of a prey determine their susceptibility to predation. 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 | Animal collection and maintenance Fifty Strongylocentrotus purpuratus were opportunistically collected by hand from the Goleta sewer pipe (34° 24.851 N; 119° 49.749 W), and 120 others were collected from Goleta Pier (34° 24.847 N; 119° 49.718 W, Goleta, CA, USA) in the summer of 2017. A total of 170 S. purpuratus were used for the experiment. The three lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) used in the experiment were transferred into our possession from another research facility on the campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) on 16 August 2017. The three P. interruptus used in the study were female, 10.5–11 cm in carapace length, and were collected by hand from the Santa Barbara Channel from May to June 2017. All S. purpuratus were provided brown algae (Nereocystis lu- etkeana) ad libitum every o",

Introduction Experts play a key role in decision-making in conserva- tion. In the absence of certainty about the nature and be- havior of complex social-ecological systems (SESs), ex- pert opinions are often elicited in hopes of separating matters of fact from matters of value to complement existing data and inform conservation decisions (Dietz 2013). Typically, technical experts communicate their understanding of social-ecological processes to decision- makers, enabling them to rely upon best available science (Ryderet al.2010). For example, assessments of oil spill impacts (e.g., major oil spills; Leschineet al.2015), cli- mate change mechanisms (e.g., IPCC 2014), and poten- tial tradeoffs associated with scientific whaling (e.g., the case for scientific whaling; de la Mareet al.2014) have all relied on expert judgment (reviewed in Redpathet al. 2013). However, experts can exhibit high levels of uncer- tainty because knowledge integration among individu- als is inherently complex (Raymondet al.2010; Drescher et al.2013), and in some cases not possible (Grayet al. 2012). Despite the potential for each expert’s training, ex- perience, and education to guide judgments (Burgman, Carret al.2011), many conservation decision-making processes focus on gathering input from select individ- uals with substantial, but not necessarily objective, infor- mation about a given topic (Burgman, Carret al.2011; Conservation Letters, xxx 2016, 0(0), 1–10 Copyright and Photocopying: C⃝ 2016 The Authors.

Expert opinion and ecosystem managementA.C. Stieretal. Martinet al.2012; Drescheret al.2013). Indeed, diver- gent views are common for two reasons. First, expert perceptions of SESs are typically based on what they have learned from experience or in the classroom (i.e., human cognition). Second, the terms employed to de- scribe SESs (e.g., ecosystem structure) are human con- structs, and the way in which perceived differences are discussed is typically qualitative, imprecise, and prone to biases in human reasoning (but see Doswaldet al.2007). For instance, differences in how the species concept is viewed by scientists (Levin 1979) have led to disputes (Heyet al.2003), with important implications for conser- vation of imperiled species (e.g., Waples 1991; Beaudreau et al.2011). Here, we document varying expert perceptions of ecosystem interactions in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and explore their implications for conservation and manage- ment. In this region, Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii)area key ecological, economic, and cultural resource. Numer- ous terrestrial and marine coastal organisms, including several commercially harvested fishes, prey on herring (Schweigertet al.2010). Herring were a major focus of in- dustrial seine and gillnet fisheries, but stock collapses in the 1960s and 1990s resulted in fisheries closures (DFO 2014) and conservation concern. Herring roe is also an important cultural and subsistence resource for a num- ber of First Nations (Joneset al.2010). Because of the central role of herring in Northeast Pacific SESs, fisheries closures and subsequent reopenings have led to tensions surrounding herring and herring fishing among First Na- tions groups, the Canadian government, and commercial fishery interests (DFO 2014). Given the numerous social and ecological connections to herring, we explored how experts from a variety of backgrounds perceived Northeast Pacific ecosystem inter- actions. We asked each expert to describe the number, direction, and strength of food web interactions among functional groups connected directly or indirectly to her- ring. Based on these responses, we constructed Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (hereafter, cognitive maps) of the her- ring ecosystem, revealing each expert’s unique percep- tion of the number, strength, and direction of relation- ships among network nodes, and how perceptions of different experts related to one another. We also sim- ulated responses of the cognitive maps to hypotheti- cal scenarios, including an increase in herring, the con- tinued recovery of humpback whales (a key herring predator), and changes in ocean productivity, asking if the logical consequences of differences in perception of ecosystem structure magnify or diminish variability in predictions about ecosystem responses to management actions. Methods Fuzzy cognitive maps To quantify variation in experts’ perceptions of the structure and function of the herring-centric food web in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, we collected cognitive maps from a range of scientific experts. Cognitive maps are basic mathematical and graphical representations of an individual’s perception of the number and strength of re- lationships among nodes in a network. In this case study, the network is the Northeast Pacific Ocean food web, and the nodes in the network are the functional groups. Knowledge constructed in this manner can externally represent an individual’s organized understanding of the workings of the world around them (Grayet al.2014). These representations of understanding can then be manipulated mathematically to indicate the logical con- sequences of an individual’s perceptions based on their understanding of the dynamics of the external world. For example, by increasing or decreasing key variables as continually high or low (referred to as “clamping”), future scenarios, such as the increased abundance of a predator, can be simulated given a specific set of perceived linkages and interaction strengths ( ̈ Ozesmi & ̈ Ozesmi 2004). This clamping is conducted until the system reaches a new equilibrium that can be compared to the steady state—the equilibrium relative abundance in the absence of a perturbation (for additional detail, see Supplementary Material). Expert elicitation To build cognitive maps of the herring ecosystem in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, we identified 14 key functional groups in the herring food web (Table S2), based on published literature (Ainsworthet al.2008; Schweigert et al.2010; DFO 2014), the authors’ natural history knowledge of important ecosystem interactions, and pilot testing with five experts inside and outside of our focal area in Haida Gwaii. While providing a particular set of functional groups can constrain cognitive maps of the system, it allows for quantitative comparisons among experts (Grayet al.2014). Experts were defined as having scientific (e.g., agency or university scientists), local (e.g., long-term residents), or traditional (i.e., First Nations) ecological knowledge and/or practical experience in the Northeast Pacific Ocean herring ecosystem. Experts were identified through stratified chain referral sampling (Biernacki & Waldorf 1981), which yielded a complete sample of 27 experts. We then explored the potential role of training, experience, and cognition as key factors 2Conservation Letters, xxx 2016, 0(0), 1–10 Copyright and Photocopying: C⃝ 2016 The Authors.

E-mail:jameal.samhouri@noaa.gov INTRODUCTION Any performance management system— whether it is focused on health care, national security, business, or the environment—restsfirst and foremost upon a reliable set of measure- ments. These measurements, or indicators, can be used to evaluate a system’s status (Otley 1999). The rise of ecosystem-based management (EBM) of the ocean is no exception to this generality. As scientists and managers have tried to move marine EBM from theory to practice (Pikitch et al. 2004, Arkema et al. 2006, Levin et al. 2009, Samhouri et al. 2013, Link and Browman 2014), a frequentfirst step has been to identify and report on indicators of ocean condi- tions (Kershner et al. 2011, Halpern et al. 2012, Andrews et al. 2015). In marine EBM and else- where, however, indicators are necessary but not sufficient for successful performance manage- ment (Otley 1999). Useful indicators must describe a system in relation to the objectives set for it (Melnyk et al. 2004). Reference points pro- vide just such a basis for comparison of an indi- cator’s value to an internal or external standard. (See Appendix S1: Table S1 for definition of indi- cator, reference point, and other terms used in the text.) Thus, they are a critical component of advancing EBM from concept to commonplace. An increasing variety of environmental perfor- mance management approaches are built around reference points, from global to local scales (Hal- pern et al. 2012, Hamel et al. 2015, UMCES 2016). For example, the most familiar reference point infisheries science is the concept of maxi- mum sustainable yield, which is calculated based on estimates of population size, carrying capac- ity, and growth rates (Hilborn and Walters 1992). One of the most informative techniques to estab- lish reference points relies upon thresholds in ecosystem state. Following Groffman et al. (2006), we define an ecosystem threshold as a large, nonlinear change in an ecosystem state indicator (e.g., biodiversity of a key species or functional group) in response to an incremental change in an anthropogenic or environmental pressure(s), such as pollution or temperature (Lackey 1998, Methratta and Link 2006, Martin et al. 2009, Samhouri et al. 2012). Determining where ecosystem thresholds occur, and how large a shift may be induced by crossing them, is key for informing management that prepares for and is designed to avoid abrupt and undesired changes (Doak et al. 2008). For instance, the concept of rising variance, where the variability in an ecosystem state(s) can pro- vide advance warning of an ecosystem shift, has led to new insights about both terrestrial and marine systems (Carpenter and Brock 2006, Sydeman et al. 2013, Litzow and Hunsicker 2016). Many analytical techniques for identifying ecosystem thresholds based on state–pressure relationships have also been proposed (Samhouri et al. 2010, Large et al. 2013, 2015a,b, Hunsicker et al. 2016), leaving an open question: Which is most appropriate, and under what conditions? Here, we propose a framework centered on multimodel inference (MMI), rather than a single statistical tool, to define ecosystem thresholds for environmental and human pressures. To illus- trate how our MMI framework can be used, we apply it to the U.S. California Current System (CCS), which supports more than $23 billion in revenue fromfisheries, tourism, and recreation (data source: NOAA Coastal Services Center, 2013 GDP data for living resources and tourism and recreation sectors; http://www.oceaneco nomics.org/). The vast majority of ocean condi- tion reports for the CCS focus on ecosystem states, as well as environmental and human pres- sures, relative to internal standards—long-term averages of conditions (Halpern et al. 2014, Har- vey et al. 2014, Leising et al. 2014, ONMS 2015, Zador 2015). Here, we seek to enhance these assessments by directly connecting variability in environmental and human pressures to the potential for nonlinear ecosystem responses. Such nonlinear ecosystem responses are common ❖www.esajournals.org2June 2017❖Volume 8(6)❖Article e01860 SAMHOURI ET AL. in many ecosystems (Hunsicker et al. 2016) and can alter the human-derived benefits of a system (Selkoe et al. 2015). As such, we believe our MMI framework that identifies ecosystem thresholds has broad application to other regions in the pro- cess of operationalizing EBM. METHODS Analytical framework We developed an analytical approach to define ecosystem thresholds for environmental and human pressures. The goal was to represent the value of a pressure relative to an inflection point in its relationship to one or more ecosystem states, and to quantify the magnitude of ecosystem change associated with crossing that value. This pressure–state approach is distinct from one that focuses on changes in state or pressure variables over time, or the time at which a threshold was crossed (Bestelmeyer et al. 2011, Scheffer et al. 2012). The workflow (Fig. 1) can be summarized in four parts, including (1) pre-treatment, (2) screening, (3) functional form id",

E-mail:jameal.samhouri@noaa.gov INTRODUCTION Any performance management system— whether it is focused on health care, national security, business, or the environment—restsfirst and foremost upon a reliable set of measure- ments. These measurements, or indicators, can be used to evaluate a system’s status (Otley 1999). The rise of ecosystem-based management (EBM) of the ocean is no exception to this generality. As scientists and managers have tried to move marine EBM from theory to practice (Pikitch et al. 2004, Arkema et al. 2006, Levin et al. 2009, Samhouri et al. 2013, Link and Browman 2014), a frequentfirst step has been to identify and report on indicators of ocean condi- tions (Kershner et al. 2011, Halpern et al. 2012, Andrews et al. 2015). In marine EBM and else- where, however, indicators are necessary but not sufficient for successful performance manage- ment (Otley 1999). Useful indicators must describe a system in relation to the objectives set for it (Melnyk et al. 2004). Reference points pro- vide just such a basis for comparison of an indi- cator’s value to an internal or external standard. (See Appendix S1: Table S1 for definition of indi- cator, reference point, and other terms used in the text.) Thus, they are a critical component of advancing EBM from concept to commonplace. An increasing variety of environmental perfor- mance management approaches are built around reference points, from global to local scales (Hal- pern et al. 2012, Hamel et al. 2015, UMCES 2016). For example, the most familiar reference point infisheries science is the concept of maxi- mum sustainable yield, which is calculated based on estimates of population size, carrying capac- ity, and growth rates (Hilborn and Walters 1992). One of the most informative techniques to estab- lish reference points relies upon thresholds in ecosystem state. Following Groffman et al. (2006), we define an ecosystem threshold as a large, nonlinear change in an ecosystem state indicator (e.g., biodiversity of a key species or functional group) in response to an incremental change in an anthropogenic or environmental pressure(s), such as pollution or temperature (Lackey 1998, Methratta and Link 2006, Martin et al. 2009, Samhouri et al. 2012). Determining where ecosystem thresholds occur, and how large a shift may be induced by crossing them, is key for informing management that prepares for and is designed to avoid abrupt and undesired changes (Doak et al. 2008). For instance, the concept of rising variance, where the variability in an ecosystem state(s) can pro- vide advance warning of an ecosystem shift, has led to new insights about both terrestrial and marine systems (Carpenter and Brock 2006, Sydeman et al. 2013, Litzow and Hunsicker 2016). Many analytical techniques for identifying ecosystem thresholds based on state–pressure relationships have also been proposed (Samhouri et al. 2010, Large et al. 2013, 2015a,b, Hunsicker et al. 2016), leaving an open question: Which is most appropriate, and under what conditions? Here, we propose a framework centered on multimodel inference (MMI), rather than a single statistical tool, to define ecosystem thresholds for environmental and human pressures. To illus- trate how our MMI framework can be used, we apply it to the U.S. California Current System (CCS), which supports more than $23 billion in revenue fromfisheries, tourism, and recreation (data source: NOAA Coastal Services Center, 2013 GDP data for living resources and tourism and recreation sectors; http://www.oceaneco nomics.org/). The vast majority of ocean condi- tion reports for the CCS focus on ecosystem states, as well as environmental and human pres- sures, relative to internal standards—long-term averages of conditions (Halpern et al. 2014, Har- vey et al. 2014, Leising et al. 2014, ONMS 2015, Zador 2015). Here, we seek to enhance these assessments by directly connecting variability in environmental and human pressures to the potential for nonlinear ecosystem responses. Such nonlinear ecosystem responses are common ❖www.esajournals.org2June 2017❖Volume 8(6)❖Article e01860 SAMHOURI ET AL. in many ecosystems (Hunsicker et al. 2016) and can alter the human-derived benefits of a system (Selkoe et al. 2015). As such, we believe our MMI framework that identifies ecosystem thresholds has broad application to other regions in the pro- cess of operationalizing EBM. METHODS Analytical framework We developed an analytical approach to define ecosystem thresholds for environmental and human pressures. The goal was to represent the value of a pressure relative to an inflection point in its relationship to one or more ecosystem states, and to quantify the magnitude of ecosystem change associated with crossing that value. This pressure–state approach is distinct from one that focuses on changes in state or pressure variables over time, or the time at which a threshold was crossed (Bestelmeyer et al. 2011, Scheffer et al. 2012). The workflow (Fig. 1) can be summarized in four parts, including (1) pre-treatment, (2) screening, (3) functional form id",

This issue is of partic- ular concern for reef-fish communities, where predation is a key process driving ecological and evolutionary dynam- ics.

KeywordsPredator–prey!Rarefaction!Coral reef!Reef fish!Assembly!Invasive predators Introduction Declines in apex predator populations can cause irruptions in the abundance and shifts in the behavior of previously suppressed mesopredators (Prugh et al.2009). This trophic ‘release’ of mesopredators is cause for conservation con- cern, because when abundant, they can cause extinctions and major shifts in ecosystem function (Crooks and Soule ́ 1999; Ritchie and Johnson2009). The reduction of apex predators and subsequent mesopredator release is a wide- spread phenomenon across ecosystems (Estes et al.2011) and is particularly prevalent in coral-reef ecosystems due to disproportionately high fishing rates at the top of the food chain (Stallings2009; DeMartini and Smith2015). Abun- dance of coral-reef mesopredators (e.g., small-bodied groupers and snappers) has also increased through the introduction of non-native predators. In some cases, these introduced predators have become extremely successful, for example, the intentionally introduced peacock grouper (Cephalopholis argus) in Hawaii (Meyer and Dierking 2011) and the accidentally introduced Pacific lionfishes (Pterois volitansandPterois miles) in the Atlantic and Caribbean (Co ˆ te ́ et al.2013) have each become numeri- cally dominant mesopredators in their respective invaded communities.

Settling fishes experience extraordi- narily high predation rates on coral reefs (Almany and Webster2006), with an average of 50% mortality in their first 48 h on the reef (i.e., a ‘predation gauntlet’). This effect of predators declines rapidly with increases in prey body size (Sogard1997; Goatley and Bellwood2016). Thus, increases in mesopredator abundance have the capacity to drive major shifts in the abundance and biodi- versity of coral-reef fish communities by amplifying the intensity of the predation gauntlet. Mesopredator effects have historically been difficult to quantify on coral reefs, because these predators often posi- tively covary in abundance and diversity with their prey due to shared reef habitat (Stier et al.2014). Therefore, only a handful of field experiments have been able to isolate the role of mesopredators in altering prey community size and composition (Hixon2015). Here, we conducted a meta- analysis of all (to our knowledge) published predation experiments to quantify the extent to which mesopredators affect prey abundance and biodiversity in coral-reef fishes. We focused on three distinct aspects of biodiversity includ- ing gamma diversity (species richness at the study scale), alpha diversity (species richness at the sample scale), and beta diversity (a measure of the spatial variability of com- munity composition among samples across the study). We also used rarefaction methods to calculate corrected alpha and beta diversity measures by accounting for the effects of abundance on biodiversity. We then compared the effects of native mesopredators to those of invasives (peacock grouper and lionfish) and briefly identified two opportunities for future research on reef–fish predator–prey dynamics. Methods Focal experiments We quantified the effects of reef-fish mesopredators on prey abundance and biodiversity in ten published studies 2002–2014 (Electronic supplementary material, ESM, Table S1). We identified these ten focal studies using extensive Google Scholar and ISI Web of Science literature searches from 1990 to 2016 in major ecological and marine journals using all combinations of the following keywords: predation, coral reef fish, predation gauntlet, reef fish, community assembly,anddepredation.Each of these ten studies was conducted with similar methods, where isolated experimental reefs were constructed in sandy environments. Prey communities were manipulated prior to each study either through the removal of all prey or through the selective removal of all recently recruited individuals. Predators were then manipulated on a subset of the patch reefs through selective additions and removals or cages; then, new prey communities were allowed to recruit to reefs with different predator treatments (control=predators absent, treat- ment=predators present). Predator manipulations were pressed in all studies (i.e., unwanted predators on control treatments were removed and predator-present treatments were maintained). Prey communities were visually surveyed by divers on a regular basis over a period of time that ranged from 42 to 120 d. Additional study details including predator species, duration, and additional manipulations of other variables such as adult damselfish abundance and habitat complexity (additional known drivers of reef-fish commu- nity assembly) can be found in ESM Table S1. Measuring prey community response We compared recruiting prey communities in experimental treatments with and without predators using five different response variables: (1) total abundance of all prey species; (2) gamma diversity measured as the species list on reefs with and without predators (i.e., the total number of prey species found in control or predator-present treatments); (3) alpha diversity measured as the number of species within a patch; (4) rarefied alpha diversity (the number of species within a patch, corrected for abundance); (5) beta diversity based on species incidence (the Jaccard index: a metric focused on the gain or loss of a species); and (6) rarefied beta diversity (Jaccard index corrected for differ- ences in abundance). We quantified beta diversity in predator and no-predator treatments by estimating the median multivariate dispersion around the multivariate centroid of the community (Anderson et al.2006). Rarefaction Communities with higher abundance tend to have higher alpha diversity and lower beta diversity (Gotelli and Col- well2001; Cardoso et al.2009; Stier et al.2016). Because alpha diversity is often strongly correlated with abundance, predation can reduce observed alpha diversity and increase observed beta diversity simply because it causes a decline in the number of prey individuals (Fig.1a, b). We used individual-based rarefaction to estimate rarefied alpha (Gotelli and Colwell2001) and beta diversity (Stier et al. 2014) because control treatments tended to have a higher abundance than those with predators. Predator-induced reductions in rarefied diversity implicate biological pro- cess(es) rather than a statistical sampling artifact (Fig.1c). We define generalist predators as those that affect prey species in proportion to prey abundance. If predators eat prey in proportion to their abundance, rarefied alpha and Coral Reefs 123 beta diversity should remain the same across predator and control treatments. If predators disproportionately consume common or rare species or alter competitive dynamics, differences in alpha and beta diversity will emerge for rarefied indices. The mesopredators involved in our meta- analysis are considered generalists though this has not been previously assessed quantitatively. For additional details on rarefaction, see ESM 2 and Stier et al. (2013b,2014). Effect sizes We estimated the effect of predators (P?) relative to predator-free controls (P-) for each study using the log- response ratio (Osenberg et al.1999): l i ¼log P i þ P i $    ;ð1Þ wherel i is the predation effect size, andP i þandP i $ represent the abundance, alpha diversity, or beta diversity of prey in the presence and absence of predators, respec- tively, for theith study.

Measuring prey community response We compared recruiting prey communities in experimental treatments with and without predators using five different response variables: (1) total abundance of all prey species; (2) gamma diversity measured as the species list on reefs with and without predators (i.e., the total number of prey species found in control or predator-present treatments); (3) alpha diversity measured as the number of species within a patch; (4) rarefied alpha diversity (the number of species within a patch, corrected for abundance); (5) beta diversity based on species incidence (the Jaccard index: a metric focused on the gain or loss of a species); and (6) rarefied beta diversity (Jaccard index corrected for differ- ences in abundance). We quantified beta diversity in predator and no-predator treatments by estimating the median multivariate dispersion around the multivariate centroid of the community (Anderson et al.2006). Rarefaction Communities with higher abundance tend to have higher alpha diversity and lower beta diversity (Gotelli and Col- well2001; Cardoso et al.2009; Stier et al.2016). Because alpha diversity is often strongly correlated with abundance, predation can reduce observed alpha diversity and increase observed beta diversity simply because it causes a decline in the number of prey individuals (Fig.1a, b). We used individual-based rarefaction to estimate rarefied alpha (Gotelli and Colwell2001) and beta diversity (Stier et al. 2014) because control treatments tended to have a higher abundance than those with predators. Predator-induced reductions in rarefied diversity implicate biological pro- cess(es) rather than a statistical sampling artifact (Fig.1c). We define generalist predators as those that affect prey species in proportion to prey abundance. If predators eat prey in proportion to their abundance, rarefied alpha and Coral Reefs 123 beta diversity should remain the same across predator and control treatments. If predators disproportionately consume common or rare species or alter competitive dynamics, differences in alpha and beta diversity will emerge for rarefied indices. The mesopredators involved in our meta- analysis are considered generalists though this has not been previously assessed quantitatively. For additional details on rarefaction, see ESM 2 and Stier et al. (2013b,2014). Effect sizes We estimated the effect of predators (P?) relative to predator-free controls (P-) for each study using the log- response ratio (Osenberg et al.1999): l i ¼log P i þ P i $    ;ð1Þ wherel i is the predation effect size, andP i þandP i $ represent the abundance, alpha diversity, or beta diversity of prey in the presence and absence of predators, respec- tively, for theith study.

From an ecosystem perspective, however, predator recovery can introduce significant new conservation and legal challenges. We highlight three types of conflicts created by a single-species focus: (1) recovering predator populations that increase competition with humans for the same prey, (2) new tradeoffs that emerge when protected predators consume protected prey, and (3) multiple predator populations that compete for the same limited prey. We use two food webs with parallel conservation challenges, the Northeast Pacific Ocean and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, to demonstrate legal/policy conflicts and the policy levers that exist to ameliorate conflicts. In some cases, scientific uncertainty about the ecological interaction hinders progress towards resolving conflicts. In others, available policy options are insufficient. In all cases, management decisions must be made in the face of an unknown future. We suggest a framework that incorporates multispecies science, policy tools, and tradeoff analyses into management.",

E-mail:adrian.stier@lifesci.ucsb.edu INTRODUCTION Within-patch (alpha) and among-patch (beta) diversities combine to produce regional patterns of diversity. Traditionally, ecologists have focused on local processes and their influence on alpha diversity. More recently, ecologists have turned to studying the drivers of beta diversity; patterns of beta diversity provide insight into the role of factors that generate species boundaries (Condit et al. 2002), facilitate regional diversity via environmental heterogeneity, and produce alternate community states (Fukami and Naka- jima 2011). From a conservation perspective, beta diversity is arguably as important as alpha diver- sity (Socolar et al. 2016): For example, quantify- ing the spatial scale of beta diversity can allow resource managers to design reserve networks that maximize species complementarity across sites (Kattan et al. 2006). Similarly, beta diversity can be used to describe the rate at which species turn over through time in the presence of human impacts (Dornelas et al. 2014). Knowledge of the factors maintaining diversity among patches can also facilitate biodiversity preservation or recov- ery of diversity following the restoration of a degraded ecosystem (McKnight et al. 2007). Beta diversity is typically examined at two spatial scales: (1) large-scale variation in beta diversity that links species compositional differ- ences across gradients (e.g., with latitude or alti- tude) and encompasses multiple species pools (Condit et al. 2002, McKnight et al. 2007, He and Zhang 2009), and (2) local-scale variation in beta ❖www.esajournals.org1December 2016❖Volume 7(12)❖Article e01612 diversity among patches representing a commu- nity drawn from a single pool. At the local scale, beta diversity is determined by four different, scale-dependent phenomena (Fig. 1): (1) changes in the species pool, which affect beta diversity primarily at large spatial scales (and which we do not consider further); (2) environmental heterogeneity driven by biotic or abiotic factors (i.e., environmentalfiltering); (3) local patch size (i.e., the total number of individuals found within a given location): For example, small patches may have high beta diversity because each patch has only a limited capacity to sample the species pool; (4) sampling effort: For exam- ple, the use of a few, small quadrats within a patch will reduce the number of individuals counted within patches, which could lead to high apparent beta diversity even when patches con- tain identical communities. Here, we focus on the latter two phenomena, patch size and sam- pling effort, as the roles of the species pool and environmental heterogeneity have been thor- oughly discussed elsewhere in the literature (e.g., Soininen et al. 2007). The effects of patch size and sampling effort (which we collectively callsampling effects) are well known in studies of alpha diversity. Well- established tools, such as rarefaction or multino- mial extrapolation, facilitate the comparison of alpha diversity among communities that differ in sampling protocols (e.g., number of samples, individuals, or coverage [fraction of the species list sampled]; Gotelli and Colwell 2001, 2011, Chao and Jost 2012, Chao et al. 2012, 2014b, Col- well et al. 2012). The importance of sampling effects in biasing estimates of beta diversity was initially demonstrated in the 1950s (Nash 1950, Morisita 1959), and has since received additional attention (Ricklefs and Lau 1980, Wolda 1981, Plotkin and Muller-Landau 2002, Cardoso et al. 2009, Tuomisto 2010a, Beck et al. 2013). Initial attempts to address sampling bias in beta diver- sity estimators have included identifying beta diversity metrics that are less sensitive to sam- pling effects (Cardoso et al. 2009) and develop- ing metrics that adjust beta diversity for unsampled species (Chao et al. 2005). Despite these advances, ecologists have not yet devel- oped tools that clearly separate sampling effects from other phenomena driving beta diversity. For example, ecological processes such as preda- tion, competition, and nutrient limitation can modify beta diversity both via environmentalfil- tering and via sampling effects (i.e., by altering the number of individuals surviving within a patch; e.g., Chase 2007, 2010, Chase et al. 2009, Stier et al. 2013).

At present, we know of no effective technique that adjusts observed beta diversity for differences in abun- dance to separate sampling effects from environ- mentalfiltering and facilitate comparison of communities (as is standard practice in studies of alpha diversity). We focus on the consequences of sampling effects (i.e., phenomena 3, patch size, and 4, sam- ple size: Fig. 1) for beta diversity estimation in scenarios with afixed species pool. We examined these two phenomena together, as their conse- quences are functionally equivalent (we have the same information about the composition of a patch from which only a few individuals have been sampled whether it was the patch or the investigator that did the sampling). Wefirst developed a stochastic simulation model to explore how sampling affects beta diversity under different situations. We then developed a rarefaction technique that adjusts observed beta diversity for sampling effects and allows the sep- aration of sampling effects from higher-level eco- logical drivers (environmentalfiltering, species pool compositions) of beta diversity. METHODS The model In contrast to recent work that generates simu- lated communities from a complex spatial model (Beck et al. 2013), we used a relatively simple stochastic simulation. Our approach sacrificed realism to facilitate interpretation of the processes driving the resulting patterns in beta diversity. We defined the beta diversity of a community as the variation in species composition among samples obtained from patches within that community. Variation is measured as distance inN-state space (whereNis the species richness of the regional pool), where each species is either represented by presence–absence data (e.g., Jaccard index) or rel- ative abundance (e.g., Manhattan index). There is a plethora of beta diversity definitions (for a recent review, see Legendre and De C   aceres 2013); we focused on metrics based on distance in N-state space (i.e., multivariate dispersion sensu Anderson et al. 2006), because we were specifi- cally interested in comparing beta diversity between multiple distinct communities; however, we expect that our results will be qualitatively similar for other metrics (seeDiscussion). Instead, we focused on metrics that quantify the variability among patches within a community. Wefirst used a simulation model to explore how observed beta diversity for a single commu- nity is affected by sampling (due to changes in either sample size or patch size) and species abundance distributions (SADs).

Levin 3 Habitat loss, overexploitation, and numerous other stressors have caused global declines in apex predators. This “trophic downgrading”has generated widespread concern because of the fundamental role that apex predators can play in ecosystem functioning, disease regulation, and biodiversity maintenance. In attempts to combat de- clines, managers have conducted reintroductions, imposedstricter harvest regulations, and implemented protected areas. We suggest that full recovery of viable apex predator populations is currently the exception rather than the rule. We argue that, in addition to well-known considerations, such as continued exploitation and slow life histories, there are several underappreciated factors that complicate predator recoveries. These factors include three chal- lenges. First, a priori identification of the suite of trophicinteractions,suchasresourcelimitationandcompetition that will influence recovery can be difficult. Second, defining and accomplishing predator recovery in the context of adynamicecosystemrequiresanappreciationofthetimingof recovery, which can determine the relative density of apex predators and other predators and therefore affect competitive outcomes. Third, successful recovery programs require designing adaptive sequences of management strategies that embrace key environmental and species in- teractions as they emerge. Consideration of recent research on food web modules, alternative stable states, and community assembly offer important insights for predator recovery efforts and restoration ecology more generally. Foremost among these is the importance of a social-ecological perspective in facilitating a long-lasting predator restoration while avoiding unintended consequences. INTRODUCTION: WHY APEX PREDATOR RECOVERY? Many of the most iconic and charismatic species in the natural world are apex predators, yet they are alsooften embedded in controversy. Apex predators (for example, whales, cougars, bears, wolves, sharks, and eagles) are consumers that kill their prey during or shortly fol- lowing an attack, consume many prey over a lifetime, and are not eat- en after reaching adult size (1). Apex predators also evoke strong emotional responses in people, varying from wonder and amazement to fear and spite (2). Because of the fundamental roles that apex pred- ators can play in ecosystem functioning, disease regulation, and bio- diversity maintenance, ecologists and conservation organizations have repeatedly sounded the alarm about local, regional, and global declines in apex predator (3)andlargeherbivorepopulations(4). Consequent- ly, efforts to recover predator populations that have experienced de- clines are increasingly widespread. Efforts to recover apex predators are implemented for a variety of reasons that span from the viability ofparticularpopulations,toeco- system functioning, to the resilience ofsocial-ecologicalsystems.Inthe simplest situation, apex predator recovery is an end in itself. Borrow- ing from language in the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), a suc- cessful recovery consists of a sequence of four events in which the predator population (i) ceases to decline, (ii) stabilizes, (iii) increases, and finally, (iv) occurs at a level thatisself-persistent[U.S.Fishand Wildlife Service (USFWS), 2011]. Moreover, considering the key role that apex predators can play in biodiversity maintenance and eco- system function, full recovery may require not only persistence but also recovery to some level consistent with historical baseline abun- dances (5). Thus, recovery is a broad term that can be achieved via a variety of mechanisms, including reintroduction and restocking (see Glossary of Terms in Box 1). Some efforts to recover apex predators have shown promising signs of sustained success. For example, gray wolves in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem [but see the study by Bergeret al.(6)], harbor seals in coastal regions of the Northeast Pacific Ocean (7), and cheetahs in Tanzania (8)reacheddesiredincreasesinabundanceanddistribu- tion following reductions in densities caused by hunting and culling (Table 1). However, many apex predator recovery efforts have not yet met their potential or have encountered unanticipated problems along the way (Table 2) (9). Apex predators that have not yet successfully recovered despite concerted conservation efforts are widespread across ecosystems (land, freshwater, or marine), taxonomic groups (for ex- ample, mammals and birds), and exploitation status. In addition, there are several cases in which a focal predator has recovered successfully in one location (for example, sea otters in central California) but not in another (for example, sea ottersin western Alaska). Although Table 2bynomeansrepresentsacomprehensivereviewofapexpredator recovery efforts, it suggests that success is not universal [for a recent comprehensive review of marine systems recoveries, see the work by Lotzeet al.(10)andLotzeandWorm(11)]. Indeed, the widespread occurrence of unsuccessful or stalled recovery efforts provokes the question: what factors encourage versus impede progress in the recov- ery of apex predators? Here, we explore four key aspects of apex predator recovery. In the first section,“Apex Predators Live Slow, Range Widely, and Die Fast,” we focus on how apex predator life history characteristics offer insight into predator recoveries.

In the third section,“When Is as Important as What: Historical Contingency and Predator Recovery,”we discuss the integration of predators into assembly theory and emphasize the role of timing as a key driver in predator recovery. Last, in the fourth section, “Prescriptions for Success? Research Gaps and Ecosystem Restoration,” we emphasize how recovery pathways are not necessarily identical as pathways to decline (that is, hysteresis), discuss theoretical and empirical research gaps, and emphasize the need to consider social as well as eco- logical systems when seeking targets for apex predator recovery. APEX PREDATORS LIVE SLOW, RANGE WIDELY, AND DIE FAST There are a variety of reasons why apex predator recovery programs often are marginally successful or even fail. One of the clearest expla- nations is that species at the apex of the food chain are known for having slow life history characteristics. Relative to prey, apex predators tend to have slower somatic growth rates, larger size atmaturity,and longer generation lengths, all life history traits correlated with fewer offspring (12,13). A low maximal reproduction rate means that it is difficult to mount compensatory responses via recruitment to en- hanced mortality. Although not exclusive to the top of the food chain, apex predators also generally have smaller population sizes and slower population growth rates than their prey (14), making them especially sensitive to extinction from demographic stochasticity (15)andcaus- ing slow recovery rates even in cases of positive population trajec- tories. For example, a review of 198 reintroduction studies found that herbivore reintroductions exhibited a 29% higher success com- pared to carnivorereintroductions (16). Additionally, a recent synthesis of recovery times for overexploited fisheries suggests that higher- trophic level species are likely to exhibit the slowest recovery rates (17). Indeed, this finding almost certainly generalizes that apex pred- ator recoveries often will be slower than those of lower-trophic level species simply because of a disparity in life history strategies. Such slower recovery times require setting appropriate expectations for the time scale of successful recovery. As we will note below, these life history effects on recovery can be amplified by community and ecosystem interactions. Directly hostile human activities can exacerbate the negative effects of slow life history strategies on predator recovery time. Continued (over-) exploitation is perhaps the most substantive of these activities [reviewed by Duffy (18)], but other direct and indirect human influ- ences can also play a role. Strong exploitation and poaching often con- tinue during recovery efforts because the predators are themselves valuable (17,19). For example, tigers are at risk of extinction due to intentional human impacts because of their lucrative commercial value in some Asian medicines (20). In other cases, apex predators are considered to be a threat to valuable species. For example, unexploited shark and wolf populations have beenconsidered threats to wildlife, fisheries, and livestock, often being killed by poachers [for example, Holdoe",

E-mail:adrian.stier@lifesci.ucsb.edu INTRODUCTION Within-patch (alpha) and among-patch (beta) diversities combine to produce regional patterns of diversity. Traditionally, ecologists have focused on local processes and their influence on alpha diversity. More recently, ecologists have turned to studying the drivers of beta diversity; patterns of beta diversity provide insight into the role of factors that generate species boundaries (Condit et al. 2002), facilitate regional diversity via environmental heterogeneity, and produce alternate community states (Fukami and Naka- jima 2011). From a conservation perspective, beta diversity is arguably as important as alpha diver- sity (Socolar et al. 2016): For example, quantify- ing the spatial scale of beta diversity can allow resource managers to design reserve networks that maximize species complementarity across sites (Kattan et al. 2006). Similarly, beta diversity can be used to describe the rate at which species turn over through time in the presence of human impacts (Dornelas et al. 2014). Knowledge of the factors maintaining diversity among patches can also facilitate biodiversity preservation or recov- ery of diversity following the restoration of a degraded ecosystem (McKnight et al. 2007). Beta diversity is typically examined at two spatial scales: (1) large-scale variation in beta diversity that links species compositional differ- ences across gradients (e.g., with latitude or alti- tude) and encompasses multiple species pools (Condit et al. 2002, McKnight et al. 2007, He and Zhang 2009), and (2) local-scale variation in beta ❖www.esajournals.org1December 2016❖Volume 7(12)❖Article e01612 diversity among patches representing a commu- nity drawn from a single pool. At the local scale, beta diversity is determined by four different, scale-dependent phenomena (Fig. 1): (1) changes in the species pool, which affect beta diversity primarily at large spatial scales (and which we do not consider further); (2) environmental heterogeneity driven by biotic or abiotic factors (i.e., environmentalfiltering); (3) local patch size (i.e., the total number of individuals found within a given location): For example, small patches may have high beta diversity because each patch has only a limited capacity to sample the species pool; (4) sampling effort: For exam- ple, the use of a few, small quadrats within a patch will reduce the number of individuals counted within patches, which could lead to high apparent beta diversity even when patches con- tain identical communities. Here, we focus on the latter two phenomena, patch size and sam- pling effort, as the roles of the species pool and environmental heterogeneity have been thor- oughly discussed elsewhere in the literature (e.g., Soininen et al. 2007). The effects of patch size and sampling effort (which we collectively callsampling effects) are well known in studies of alpha diversity. Well- established tools, such as rarefaction or multino- mial extrapolation, facilitate the comparison of alpha diversity among communities that differ in sampling protocols (e.g., number of samples, individuals, or coverage [fraction of the species list sampled]; Gotelli and Colwell 2001, 2011, Chao and Jost 2012, Chao et al. 2012, 2014b, Col- well et al. 2012). The importance of sampling effects in biasing estimates of beta diversity was initially demonstrated in the 1950s (Nash 1950, Morisita 1959), and has since received additional attention (Ricklefs and Lau 1980, Wolda 1981, Plotkin and Muller-Landau 2002, Cardoso et al. 2009, Tuomisto 2010a, Beck et al. 2013). Initial attempts to address sampling bias in beta diver- sity estimators have included identifying beta diversity metrics that are less sensitive to sam- pling effects (Cardoso et al. 2009) and develop- ing metrics that adjust beta diversity for unsampled species (Chao et al. 2005). Despite these advances, ecologists have not yet devel- oped tools that clearly separate sampling effects from other phenomena driving beta diversity. For example, ecological processes such as preda- tion, competition, and nutrient limitation can modify beta diversity both via environmentalfil- tering and via sampling effects (i.e., by altering the number of individuals surviving within a patch; e.g., Chase 2007, 2010, Chase et al. 2009, Stier et al. 2013).

At present, we know of no effective technique that adjusts observed beta diversity for differences in abun- dance to separate sampling effects from environ- mentalfiltering and facilitate comparison of communities (as is standard practice in studies of alpha diversity). We focus on the consequences of sampling effects (i.e., phenomena 3, patch size, and 4, sam- ple size: Fig. 1) for beta diversity estimation in scenarios with afixed species pool. We examined these two phenomena together, as their conse- quences are functionally equivalent (we have the same information about the composition of a patch from which only a few individuals have been sampled whether it was the patch or the investigator that did the sampling). Wefirst developed a stochastic simulation model to explore how sampling affects beta diversity under different situations. We then developed a rarefaction technique that adjusts observed beta diversity for sampling effects and allows the sep- aration of sampling effects from higher-level eco- logical drivers (environmentalfiltering, species pool compositions) of beta diversity. METHODS The model In contrast to recent work that generates simu- lated communities from a complex spatial model (Beck et al. 2013), we used a relatively simple stochastic simulation. Our approach sacrificed realism to facilitate interpretation of the processes driving the resulting patterns in beta diversity. We defined the beta diversity of a community as the variation in species composition among samples obtained from patches within that community. Variation is measured as distance inN-state space (whereNis the species richness of the regional pool), where each species is either represented by presence–absence data (e.g., Jaccard index) or rel- ative abundance (e.g., Manhattan index). There is a plethora of beta diversity definitions (for a recent review, see Legendre and De C   aceres 2013); we focused on metrics based on distance in N-state space (i.e., multivariate dispersion sensu Anderson et al. 2006), because we were specifi- cally interested in comparing beta diversity between multiple distinct communities; however, we expect that our results will be qualitatively similar for other metrics (seeDiscussion). Instead, we focused on metrics that quantify the variability among patches within a community. Wefirst used a simulation model to explore how observed beta diversity for a single commu- nity is affected by sampling (due to changes in either sample size or patch size) and species abundance distributions (SADs). All code is available in Appendix S1; community simulator is detailed in Appendix",

Introduction Body size is a fundamental factor governing the effects of predators on prey [1]. Larger predators tend to have higher consumption rates due to their larger mouths and experience [2], 2016 The Authors.

Predator body size can also mediate the indirect effects of predators on prey; for example, a prey’s perception of risk can increase with predator body size [4]. As ecosystems continue to experience decreases in predator body size due to the aggregate effect of disproportionate harvesting of large-bodied organisms [5]and the potential trophic release of smaller bodied predators (i.e. mesopredator release) [6], we will require a more detailed, mechanistic understanding of how predator body size mediates the effects of predators on prey. Coral reefs are home to a diverse community of predators that vary in body size within and among species [7]. Surveys across gradients in exploitation pressure have demonstrated clear shifts in species composition and size structure within and among predator species [8], which has key implications for the rate at which energy flows throughout these nutrient poor ecosystems [9]. Experiments have demonstrated that predation is a key ecological force driving the population dynamics, biodiversity and community assembly of coral reef fishes [10–12], highlighting how the role of predation can shift with predator identity [13] and density [14]. However, the role of intraspecific variation in predator body size in mediating the effects of predators on prey remains understudied. Disentangling such size-dependent effects of predators on prey in coral reef fishes is critical to improving our understanding of how natural and anthropogenically induced variation in predator size affects the dynamics, structure and stability of coral reef communities. In this study, we combine field observations and a laboratory experiment to quantify how intraspecific variation in the body size of a coral reef mesopredator (Parracirrhites arcatus) mediates its effect on prey fish communities in Moorea, French Polynesia. Specifically, we hypothesized that, if body size affects the direct and indirect effects ofP. a r c a t u son prey, prey fishes would be (i) less likely to co-inhabit coral heads occupied by largeP. a r c a t u sthan by smallP. a r c a t u s, and (ii) that attack rates of largeP. a r c a t u s under laboratory settings would be higher compared with smallP. a r c a t u s. If, however, body size has limited influence on the effects ofP. a r c a t u son prey, we predicted no difference between small and large P. a r c a t u sin both the field study (occupation of coral heads by prey fishes) and the laboratory study (survival of prey in tanks). 2. Material and methods This study was conducted on a shallow back-reef on the north side of Moorea, French Polynesia (17°30   S, 149°50   W). The site is situated on the lagoonal edge of a barrier reef, which encircles the entire island and is defined by dense patches of reef and sand, with a depth range of 2–4 m. The arc-eye hawkfish (P. a r c a t u s) is a voracious, diurnal and territorial ambush predator in this system, and is commonly observed perched upon the coral branches ofPocilloporaspp. andAcroporaspp. [15].Parracirrhites arcatus are usually solitary with home ranges limited to approximately 5 m, resulting in the often sustained residence of singular individuals on the same coral head [16]. Their prey consists of a range of small fishes and invertebrates, including the two damselfish speciesChromis viridisandDascyllus flavicaudus. Both prey fish species are known to be extremely limited in their movements, commonly residing within 1 m of the coral head to which they recruited [17]. To assess the indirect effects of hawkfish of different sizes on their prey, we quantified patterns of hawkfish and their co-occurrence with other reef fishes by noting the presence of hawkfish and sympatric fish species, blue-green chromis (C. viridis) and the yellowtail damselfish (D. flavicaudus), on Pocillopora eydouxicoral heads along randomized 50 m belt-transect surveys parallel to the coastline. Surveys (N=27) were conducted in the mornings (06.30–08.30) three times per week from 23 January to 13 February 2009. Previous work removing hawkfish from reefs in the same region showed that hawkfish presence decreased the density of small, coral-associated fishes [18]; however, the influence of size in these relationships remains unclear. Thus, if hawkfish were present, we visually estimated their standard length. The distribution of estimated fish sizes was bimodal; therefore, we classified hawkfish size categorically into two size classes: large (more than 4 cm TL) and small (less than or equal to 4 cm TL). WhileP. a r c a t u scan grow to a maximum size of 20 cm, lagoonal systems are often characterized by the disproportional presence of small life-stages of reef fishes. Accordingly, during our transects no individuals approaching maximum size were observed. While both size classes are well beyond juvenile stages, individuals less than 4 cm TL may be characterized as sub-adults, while larger individuals are considered adults. We also estimated the abundance of other fishes within a 0.5 m lateral or vertical radius of the coral head. Each diver measured the dimensions of each coral head (length, width and height, in centimetres); no coral heads were surveyed more than once. on December 7, 2016http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/Downloaded from 3 rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R.Soc. opensci. 3 : 160414 ................................................

Evidence indicates that explicitly addressing tipping points leads to improved management outcomes. Drawing on theory and examples from marine systems, we distill a set of seven principles to guide effective management in ecosystems with tipping points, derived from the best available science. These principles are based on observations that tipping points (1) are possible everywhere, (2) are associated with intense and/or multifaceted human use, (3) may be preceded by changes in early- warning indicators, (4) may redistribute benefits among stakeholders, (5) affect the relative costs of action and inaction, (6) suggest biologically informed management targets, and (7) often require an adaptive response to monitoring. We suggest that early action to preserve system resilience is likely more practical, affordable, and effective than late action to halt or reverse a tipping point. We articulate a conceptual approach to management focused on linking management targets to thresholds, tracking early-warning signals of ecosystem instability, and stepping up investment in monitoring and mitigation as the likelihood of dramatic ecosystem change increases. This approach can simplify and economize management by allowing decision makers to capitalize on the increasing value of precise information about threshold relationships when a system is closer to tipping or by ensuring that restoration effort is sufficient to tip a system into the desired regime.

Tipping points can be quantified as zones of rapid change in a nonlinear relationship between ecosystem condition and intensity of a driver (Fig. 1, Table 2). For those who have witnessed collapsing fish stocks, cascading effects of eutrophication or overfishing, or climate-driven shifts in food webs, such tipping points may be intuitively understood. Nevertheless, rapid ecological shifts may surprise us, particularly when we have assumed linear, additive, and gradual ecological responses to impacts of human uses or natural drivers. Unanticipated ecological changes can be socially, culturally, and economically costly (Doak et al. 2008, Scheffer et al. 2009, Travis et al. 2014). For instance, in many aquatic systems, gradual increases in nutrient loading may have limited impacts on aquatic and marine ecosystems until a threshold nutrient level is reached, creating harmful algal blooms and oxygen-depleted zones that threaten water quality, human health, and animal life (e.g., Rabalais et al. 2010, Johannessen and Miles 2011, Michalak et al. 2013). However, for decades, water quality managers assumed constant, linear relationships between sewage discharge and impacts on local waterbodies, such as Lake Washington in Seattle, Washington, USA, and Tampa Bay, Florida, USA (Edmondson and Lehman 1981, Greening and Janicki 2006). Many such waterbodies have since tipped rapidly from clear-water, productive ecosystems to algal-dominated environments that pose health risks, compromise recreation, and threaten aquatic life. Given increasing evidence and understand- ing of complex system behavior and ecosystem tipping points, scientists, managers, stakeholders, and policy- makers may benefit from new or renewed consideration of how plans and strategies can account for possible tipping points, whether the context is ecosystem-based management, environmental restoration, single-sector management (e.g., fisheries), or comprehensive spatial planning. Our focus here is on managing marine systems prone to tipping points, but the issues and solutions we discuss are relevant to any setting in which ecosystems are likely to exhibit tipping points. A recent synthesis of managed ecosystems showed that, in a variety of settings, manage- ment strategies that include monitoring ecosystem state and identifying measurable tipping points tend to be more effective in achieving stated conservation and manage- ment goals than strategies that do not consider possible tipping points (Kelly et al. 2014b). As a precursor to tackling implementation, this study lays out the motiva- tions and principles for acknowledging and addressing the potential for tipping points in marine ecosystems. Although many of these ideas have been articulated individually elsewhere, we synthesize them in a cohesive, accessible format, supported by theory (Table 2) and applied specifically to marine natural resource manage- ment. Our focus on marine tipping points complements recent efforts to list key challenges of applying resilience theory to social-ecological systems (Walker and Salt 2012) and principles for enhancing resilience of ecosystem services (Biggs et al. 2012). Our approach is inspired by similar efforts to translate broad scientific insights and management ideals into specific planning guidelines by articulating principles of ecosystem-based management and marine spatial planning (Leslie and McLeod 2007, Foley et al. 2010). Seven Principles for Managing Ecosystem Tipping Points In a series of five workshops held in 2013 and 2014 with subsets of the coauthors and a dozen other scientists, marine managers, stewards, and policymakers (see Acknowledgements), we sought to generate and then prioritize a short list of principles for managing marine ecosystems prone to tipping points. We began by articulating fundamental traits of ecological and social- ecological tipping points, derived from ecological resilience theory, that participants felt were most relevant to management (Table 2). We describe these traits using examples from marine systems. Next, we discuss the significance of these traits for management of social-ecological systems in marine and coastal settings. Management principles were generated through group discussion and drawn from existing literature on application of theory to management practice (Table 3). 1. Tipping points are common The ecological literature provides numerous examples of nonlinear relationships between predictor and response variables, including responses exhibited at individual, population, species, and ecosystem levels. Examples of fundamental, ubiquitous, nonlinear responses include density dependence, such as the logistic curve of population growth, the Allee effect (i.e., accelerating likelih",

Introduction Emerging interest in eco-evolutionary dynamics has resulted in a growing number of studies documenting the ways by which evolution can influence popu- lation dynamics [1–3], community assembly [4–7] and ecosystem function [8]. A critical component of the eco-evolutionary framework is to determine how phenotypic variation from local adaptation affects the way individuals and popu- lations interact with their biotic and abiotic environment [5]. Local adaptation, or the evolution of traits that provide an advantage under local environmental con- ditions, is a key mode by which evolution shapes contemporary ecological dynamics [5,8–10]. To date, the best case studies detailing the ecological & 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved. on July 25, 2015http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/Downloaded from consequences of evolution stem from local adaptation in predators and subsequent shifts in trophic cascades [5,9,11]. For example, species pairs of a predatory fish, three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus; hereafter stickleback), which have repeatedly evolved into sympatric benthivorous and zooplanktivorous ecotypes, cause shifts in the structure of the zooplankton community and alter light availability in a mesocosm environment [8]. Similarly, alewives, guppies and salamanders have been shown to exhibit phenotypic variation stemming from evolution that has impacts on the abundances of associated species and ecosystem processes [5,9,11]. These find- ings reinforce that top-down control is a fundamental driver of community assembly and ecosystem function [4,12,13] and shed light on the role of intraspecific variation and evolutionary processes in the effects of predation [14,15]. In parallel with the study of the ecological impacts of evolution, there has been significant effort over the past decade to understand how community structure and ecosys- tem function are altered by genetic and phenotypic variation within dominant or foundation plant species (e.g. community genetics, [16]). This effort has yielded substantial evidence that genetic variation in primary producers can have strong bottom-up effects on community structure, such as the invert- ebrates and microbes associated with host plants, as well as ecosystem functions, such as primary productivity, decompo- sition and nutrient cycling [17–22]. For example, variation in the quantity and quality of leaf litter inputs among different genotypes ofPopulus trichocarpa(hereafter referred to as black cottonwood) modifies phytoplankton abundance, light avail- ability and nutrients in aquatic mesocosms into which leaf litter was deposited [10]. Collectively, previous research demonstrates that genetic and phenotypic variation at the bottom of the food web can fundamentally alter community structure and ecosystem function. Taken together, eco-evolutionary dynamics and commu- nity genetics have explored the role of local adaptation in driving phenotypic variation in the strength of both bottom-up and top-down processes, albeit in independent experiments. Yet, local adaptation is common and is likely present in a multitude of co-occurring species across different trophic levels [23]. As such, extending the eco- evolutionary framework to include intraspecific variation in multiple species within an ecosystem is critical to under- standing the role of evolution in ecosystems. Moreover, ecologists have long recognized that bottom-up and top- down forces interact to shape communities [24,25]. For example, the level of productivity of a system can mediate the strength of top-down effects [26,27]. Therefore, our under- standing of the impacts of evolutionary change on ecology could benefit greatly from the adoption of a multi-trophic perspective. To fully grasp the link between evolutionary change and ecology, we require a quantitative understanding of the strength of the direct and interactive effects of genetic variation at the top and bottom of food webs on associated communities and ecosystem function. In this study, we examined the strength of the direct and interactive effects of phenotypic variation stemming from local adaptation within the top and bottom of an aquatic food web. In a large field array, we integrated a common garden containing five genotypes of black cottonwood with aquatic mesocosms (cattle tanks) housing one of two eco- types of stickleback or a no-fish control (see figure 1 for a picture of the experimental set-up). Stickleback act as important predators in their natal lakes and in aquatic meso- cosms [28,29], whereas seasonal pulses of leaf litter by terrestrial riparian plants can dictate trophic interactions and nutrient cycling as a cross ecosystem subsidy in a range of aquatic systems [30,31]. Genotypes of black cotton- wood and ecotypes of stickleback both exhibit phenotypic variation from local adaptation to their natal environments [32,33]. To understand the importance of the direct and inter- active effects of evolution, we ask two questions: (i) does intraspecific genetic variation in species at different trophic levels (i.e. cottonwood and stickleback) interact to shape com- munity structure and ecosystem function? (ii) How do the strengths of direct and interactive evolutionary effects (black cottonwood genotype and/or stickleback ecotype) compare with the ecological impacts of predator presence? The top-down effects that result from the addition of fish predators are well documented and led us to the prediction that presence of a fish predator alone will have cascading effects on both aquatic communities and ecosystem function [29,34]. Ecologists have recognized that the level of productivity of a system can mediate the strength of these top-down effects [26,27]. As such, we predict that terrestrial subsidies from the most productive black cottonwood genotypes with the greatest litter inputs to the aquatic habitat will lead to stronger impacts of fish presence compared with less productive clones. Finally, we predict that local adaptation in black cottonwood and stickleback ecotypes will interact to effect aquatic ecosystem function. This interaction will stem from benthic ecotypes, which feed primarily in the littoral area on benthic invertebrates that are strongly influenced by leaf litter [28,30], having the largest effect when paired with the most productive black cot- tonwood genotypes. Ultimately, our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the community and ecosystem consequences top-",

Conversely, what do mutualisms do for communities? This chapter addresses both questions, using examples ranging from giraffes nibbling on ant-laden acacias, to rapidly shifting coral-algal symbioses, to models of stage-structure interactions among mutualists. For an interaction between a pair of species to be mutualistic, benefits must exceed costs for each partner. Yet any benefits or costs often depend upon interactions with species outside just the interacting pair. This leads to context dependence in mutualisms, since the presence and abundance of these third (or more) parties change over space and time. Evaluating costs and benefits requires accounting for shifting suites of interactions over the lifetimes of focal species. Mutualisms can arise between guilds, not just species pairs, and guild diversity can influence mutualism functioning in ways analogous to the routes by which biodiversity impacts ecosystem functioning. Mutualisms influence communities in many ways. For starters, maintenance of diversity within mutualist guilds is itself an important slice of the general issue of biodiversity maintenance. Moreover, mutualisms modulate other mechanisms that influence diversity, at times enhancing dominance of some species over others (thus reducing diversity), and at times by providing additional avenues for niche differentiation, enhancing diversity. Mutualisms can alter species range limits and thus define the species pool available for local community assembly, and even alter community stability. The chapter ends with key open questions.",

Palmer, Elizabeth G. Pringle, Adrian stier, and Robert D. Holt 9.1 Introduction In the highlands of East Africa, a giraffe ambles through a savanna dotted with Acacia drepanolo- bium trees, which stand half the giraffe’s height and bristle with spines and bulbous hollow struc- tures known colloquially as whistling thorns. The trees are myrmecophytes, or ant-plants, members of an iconic class of protection mutualisms first elucidated by Janzen (1966) nearly fifty years ago. As the giraffe lowers its head to feed from a tree, ants stream from the hollow domatia and attack its lips and nostrils. Surprisingly, the giraffe is un- perturbed: it continues to browse, using its long prehensile tongue to wipe the ants away. Closer in- spection reveals another surprise: the Crematogaster nigriceps ants that occupy this plant have method- ically pruned it, sterilizing the tree by destroying the buds that would have developed into flowers and fruits. This is all occurring even as the tree pays heavily to support C. nigriceps, channeling energy into the production of extrafloral nectar that feeds the ants and domatia that house them. Indeed, the metabolic cost of these investments is sufficient to reduce the plant’s growth rate. From the classic pairwise perspective of species interactions, there- fore, C. nigriceps appears to be a parasite of its host plant, imposing multiple costs while providing no obvious benefit. Yet we now know that this relation- ship is in fact mutualistic, providing both growth and reproductive benefits to host trees (Palmer et al. 2010). How can this be the case? The answer lies in the community context of the interaction. To fully understand the ecology and evolution of mutualism, we must consider other partners in the mutualism, and also the many non- mutualistic interactors in the community. And so in turn we must broaden both the spatial and tem- poral scopes of mutualism studies: for A. drepanolo- bium, the balance sheet of costs and benefits may be kept for 150 years or longer, and lifetime fitness is the only currency that matters in the end. By taking a community-based, long-term per- spective, we can unpack the apparent paradox of this A. drepanolobium–C. nigriceps interaction. In terms of defense, C. nigriceps is not very effective at defending host plants from chronic giraffe her- bivory (Stanton and Palmer 2011), but it is highly effective against rare but potentially lethal elephant herbivory (Goheen and Palmer 2010). Indeed, long- term studies of the interaction have shown that elephants appear to be a driving force in the evolu- tion of this association (Stanton and Palmer 2011). In terms of sterilization, C. nigriceps is but one of four ant species that compete intensely for exclu- sive occupancy of the tree, and it is the only ant that sterilizes the tree. As a subordinate ant in the competitive hierarchy, C. nigriceps persists in part by being a strong colonizer of new host plants. It therefore tends to occupy plants at early life stages, when reproductive potential is low. For young plants, protection from elephants is more important for lifetime fitness than squeezing out a few seeds: it is better for the individual to survive to repro- duce at a larger, less vulnerable, and more fecund stage. As plants mature, competitively superior, non-sterilizing ant species supplant C. nigriceps, re- leasing the plant from reproductive suppression. However, these other ants do not defend the tree as effectively against elephants. In the context of 160 MUtUALIsM of the broader community. In this chapter, we elab- orate on the themes underpinning the ant–acacia example, arguing that much recent progress in our understanding of mutualism has been made by carefully considering spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the broader communities in which mutualisms are embedded. We begin by discussing the com- plexity inherent in mutualisms, which typically consist of multiple species on one or both sides of the interaction. We then move on to consider the role of the broader community in shaping mutual- isms, briefly discussing how mutualisms arise from and are changed by the interactions with the organ- isms that surround them. Finally, we consider how mutualisms themselves feedback to modify the structure and stability of the communities in which they occur. long-term community dynamics, therefore, C. ni- griceps enhances the tree’s lifetime fitness by con- ferring increased survival at the vulnerable early stage. Moreover, the cost to the trees occupied by C. nigriceps in terms of current reproduction is out- weighed by the sum of future offspring (Palmer et al. 2010). Although the Acacia drepanolobium–ant mutual- ism is a highly specialized and geographically restricted interaction, it shares common features with many of the world’s mutualisms. Mutual- isms nearly always include a diversity of interact- ing species (Box 9.1, by Michael Stat, highlights the diversity within coral-algal symbioses), vari- ation in the costs imposed and benefits provided by different mutualist partners, and interactions between mutualists and non-mutualist members Michael Stat Many corals form a mutually beneficial interaction with single-celled algae belonging to the dinoflagellate genus symbiodinium. the association is primarily defined by the exchange of nutritional compounds that increases the meta- bolic capacity of the partners in the otherwise nutrient-poor oligotrophic ocean waters where corals are found (Mus- catine and Porter 1977). the animal host receives organic carbon fixed through algal photosynthesis as well as amino acids, while the dinoflagellate symbiont receives inorganic compounds as a byproduct of host respiration. this highly efficient cycling of nutrients between the partners is made possible by the spatially intimate localization of the sym- bionts that are housed within the gastrodermal tissue of the animal, and ultimately results in the growth of corals and formation of reef ecosystems (Box 9.1 Figure 1). In coral-algal mutualism, it has become evident that a dynamic interaction between the host and a diverse commu- nity of dinoflagellate symbionts occurs. this discovery was made possible with the application of molecular tools to identify different populations of symbiodinium. In contrast to the limited morphological variation among symbiodinium algae that contributed to the earlier perception of a single species within the genus inhabiting all corals (and other animal hosts), molecular techniques have revealed a rela- tively large amount of genetic diversity within this taxonomic group as compared to other dinoflagellate genera. to date, nine divergent evolutionary lineages that have been called clades A–I have been identified in the genus, with each lineage containing varying numbers of strains or subclade symbiont types (Pochon and Gates 2010). the importance of the genetic diversity among members of symbiodinium is recognized by the functional diversity displayed by different symbiont types and their effect on host fitness. For example, differences among symbiodinium strains in photophysiology, thermal tolerance, and carbon fixation and translocation to the host, and their subsequent effect on coral growth rates have been observed (Little et al. 2004, Rowan 2004, Cantin et al. 2009). the majority of corals associate with a single dominant strain of symbiodinium. However, recent research has now shown that most, if not all, corals also harbor a diversity of cryptic symbionts or symbiodinium strains in very low num- bers (silverstein et al. 2012). While there are biogeographic and host specificity patterns in the distribution of the domin- ant symbionts of corals, providing evidence for an evolution- ary influence on host–symbiont assemblages (LaJeunesse 2005), the functional role and interaction of cryptic sym- bionts with corals and their contribution to the stability and overall persistence of the symbiosis is unclear. Interestingly, changes in the community composition of symbiodinium in corals away from the dominant homologous symbiont have Box 9.1 The community ecology of coral-algal mutualism MUtUALIsM In A CoMMUnItY ContEXt 161 been observed during ontogeny of the coral and in response to local environmental changes. Coral-algal symbioses are very sensitive to variation and changes in the environment. Elevated seawater tempera- ture (and a variety of other abiotic factors) can cause a breakdown in the symbiosis between corals and their dino- flagellate algae, leading to the expulsion of the algal com- plement from the host tissue, and resulting in the phenotype described as coral bleaching (Hoegh-Guldberg and smith 1989). Prolonged exposure to temperature increases as little as 1 °C above the local average maximum can potentially lead to coral bleaching and mortality. During thermal stress (and other factors that affect the symbiosis), however, a disruption in the symbiotic interaction between the partners provides the opportunity for different symbiodinium strains to proliferate and occupy the coral host environment (i.e. op- portunistic symbionts). For some corals, shifts toward a more thermally tolerant symbiont population during ocean warm- ing have been shown to occur, buffering the coral against the stress event and increasing their resistance to bleaching (Jones et al. 2008). While changes in the symbiont community to thermally tolerant symbiodinium may provide a rapid mechanism of acclimatization for corals, there is a trade-off to such Box 9.1 Continued continued Figure 1 (a) the corals on the forereef of Moorea, French Polynesia, that grow and thrive as a result of the mutualistic association between corals and algae belonging to the genus symbiodinium.

Simulation models are widely used to represent the dynamics of ecological systems. A common question with such models is how changes to a parameter value or functional form in the model alter the results. Some authors have chosen to answer that question using frequentist statistical hypothesis tests (e.g. ANOVA). This is inappropriate for two reasons. First, p-values are determined by statistical power (i.e. replication), which can be arbitrarily high in a simulation context, producing minuscule p-values regardless of the effect size. Second, the null hypothesis of no difference between treatments (e.g. parameter values) is known a priori to be false, invalidating the premise of the test. Use of p-values is troublesome (rather than simply irrelevant) because small p-values lend a false sense of importance to observed differences. We argue that modelers should abandon this practice and focus on evaluating the magnitude of differences between simulations. A growing number of authors in the ecological literature use statistical methods common to experimental ecology to analyze the output of ecological simulation models. For example, authors may use analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test whether model runs with different parameter values or different functional forms produce statistically different outputs. We view significance testing applied to simulation model output as a misuse of statistical theory. In this article we explain our reasoning with the goals of discouraging the practice, encouraging instead a focus on the magnitude of differences between simulations (i.e. effect sizes), and sparking discussion regarding when – if ever – statistical sig- nificance tests could be appropriate. The perils of placing too much emphasis on statistical tests are well known in ecology. The past few decades have seen several essays reminding ecologists not to con- flate statistical with biological significance, that p-values are essentially arbitrary thresholds, and that p-values are meaningless unless accompanied by measures of effect size and statistical power (Yoccoz 1991, Johnson 1999, Hurlbert and Lombardi 2009, Beninger et al. 2012). The use of frequentist statistical tests in a simulation model set- ting presents two additional issues, the first practical and the second philosophical: 1) Statistical power is determined by replication (Berkson 1938), which is a trivial notion in the era of modern computing. Therefore power, and thus p-values, are determined only by the number of simulations one chooses to run. 2) The ‘truth’ of a testable null hypothesis is assumed to be unknown. In a model context, the programmer knows the ‘truth’ (because they know the model parameters) and testing a known-to-be-false null hypothesis does not provide useful information (Savage 1957, Johnson 1999, Anderson et al. 2000). While we contend that a focus on statistical significance is inappropriate, we also argue that quantitative evaluation of differences in effect size among model scenarios is entirely Oikos 123: 385–388, 2014 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.01073.x Published 2013.

Moreover, in some cases frequentist statistical models (e.g. regression, ANOVA) may provide accessible and simple methods for quantifying effect sizes. Though the distinction between statistical and biological significance (Yoccoz 1991) may at first appear subtle, it is critical. Below we use a few recent examples from the ecological lit- erature to illustrate the context in which these issues arise, highlight potential pitfalls in the analysis and interpretation of simulation model output, and offer ways forward for the specific examples mentioned here and for analysis and interpretation of simulation model output in general. MANOVA with n   24 000 Marzloff et al. (2013) present a validation and sensitivity analysis of TRITON, a simulation model of alternative-state dynamics in temperate rocky reef communities that centers on trophic interactions between lobsters Jasus edwardsii, sea urchins Centrostephanus rodgersii and seaweeds Ecklonia radiata and Phyllospora comosa. As part of their sensitivity analysis they compared the effects of alternative formulations of the lobster predatory functional response (Holling type I, II or III). To do so they performed 8000 simulations with random initial conditions and used MANOVA to compare the effects of functional response (the fixed effect) on a multivariate index of community state. They found that the form of the functional response had a highly significant effect in the MANOVA (p 10  15 , F 2,23997   67.5), but conceded that of course this significance was due to having nearly 24 000 denominator degrees of freedom in the F-test. They therefore ignored the MANOVA results and simply com- pared model results visually, concluding that the predator functional response had little effect on community state despite the exceedingly low p-value. This example nicely illustrates the two key problems we have identified. The question Marzloff et al. (2013) were attempting to answer (does the lobster functional response affect the predictions of their model regarding community state?) was not suited for null hypothesis testing. We know a priori from analytical models that different forms of the predator functional response produce distinct dynamics (Oaten and Murdoch 1975a, b), so the question is not whether the model outcomes will be different, but rather how different they will be. Even if we did not have the advantage of prior knowledge about the dynamical conse- quences of differences between functional responses, it would still be redundant to test for those differences using a null hypothesis framework. The null hypothesis is implic- itly posed as follows: ‘model results using each of the three functional responses are drawn from populations with identical distributions’. Because we know the model was programmed with different functions and parameters in each case, we also know a priori that the null hypothesis is false. Thus any failure to reject the null hypothesis is by definition a type-II error, and the test merely needs suffi- cient power to detect an effect and avoid that error. The second problem with hypothesis tests like the one Marzloff et al. (2013) perform is the arbitrariness of statisti- cal power itself in this setting. A sample size of 24,000 will generally produce a significant result (p 0.05, or even much lower) regardless of the magnitude of the biological effect size. Indeed, when dealing with this type of model, one can literally choose the desired p-value by setting the number of runs. With sufficient computer time, there is no limit to how small a value can be obtained. This sample size influence occurs, of course, in empirical experiments, not just computer simulations: any effect size, no matter how small, can be found significant if one is able to obtain enough replicates (Berkson 1938). However the ease and extremely low cost of replication in a simulation model set- ting represents an absurd extreme for this general principle. Marzloff et al. (2013) were correct to disregard the low p-values in their MANOVA, although we disagree with their choice to fall back on a qualitative visual inspection of the model output. A better alternative would have been to directly quantify the effect size in the MANOVA (or simply compare the distributions of community states; in their case a geomet- ric comparison of the positions of model solutions in principal components space), having determined beforehand what magnitude of difference (perhaps a percentage difference from some baseline) would constitute a significant ecological effect in the study system. This is analogous to the argument that ecologists should focus on ‘biological significance’ rather than statistical significance (Berkson 1942, Yoccoz 1991). Ecological simulation models are not the only context in which one could argue that the null hypothesis is known to be false a priori. Johnson (1999) catalogues several trivial null hypotheses that were rejected in empirical field studies (e.g. that logged and unlogged forests have the same den- sity of trees). Johnson (1999) and others have argued that null hypotheses are us",

Keywords Axolotl, cell cycle, limb, metamorphosis, regeneration, salamander Introduction The ability of some animals to regenerate missing body parts has fascinated scientists for centuries, and the clinical value of tissue regeneration has driven this topic to the forefront of current scientific inquiry (Davenport 2005). Appendage re- generation is widespread among metazoans, and the ability to regenerate damaged tissue was probably present in basal vertebrates (Bely and Nyberg 2010). However, appendage regeneration is deficient or absent in most extant vertebrates. This begs the question: what factors constrain regeneration in some animals? Although a great deal of research has been aimed at understanding the cellular and molecular mecha- nisms of regeneration, few studies have addressed how fun- damental organismal traits such as body size, age, or stage of the life-cycle may affect regenerative ability. Interpret- ing how these factors influence regeneration in some species could reveal the key cellular and molecular mechanisms that could promote regeneration in other animals. The limb has long served as a classic model to elucidate the cellular mechanisms that control appendage regenera- tion (Rose 1944; Polezhayev 1946; Wallace 1981; Stocum and Cameron 2011). Following limb amputation, epithelial cells migrate from the cut edge and cover the wound sur- face; this forms the wound epithelium, which is a special- ized signaling center required for successful regeneration. Beneath the wound epithelium, cells are stimulated to re- enter the cell cycle (Globus et al. 1980) and accumulate to form a blastema, a mass of lineage-restricted progenitor cells that will eventually replace the missing limb (reviewed in C⃝ 2014 The Authors.Regenerationpublished by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

R. Monaghanet al. Monaghan and Maden 2012). As blastemal cells proliferate they integrate patterning and growth signals, eventually dif- ferentiating to form a fully patterned miniature limb that will continue growing. Examining species where limb regenera- tion has been lost or restricted suggests that cellular changes during ontogenetic development have curtailed the ability to mount a regenerative response and replace damaged tissue (Goss 1987; S ́ anchez Alvarado 2000; Bely 2010; Seifert et al. 2012a; Seifert and Voss 2013). Supporting this idea, studies of appendage regeneration across numerous animal models have documented a cor- relation between ontogenetic development and progressive loss of regenerative ability. Embryonic and larval anamniotes (fishes and amphibians) exhibit an almost limitless ability to regenerate their appendages, and mammalian embryos are capable of regenerating digit tips (Han et al. 2003). In con- trast, while some fishes, lizards and urodeles are capable of regenerating appendages as adults, frogs and mammals lose the ability either just prior to metamorphosis (frogs) (Dent 1962) or during post embryonic development (mammals) (Han et al. 2008). Interestingly, metamorphosis imposes sim- ilar constraints on regeneration among the distantly related arthropods (insects, arachnids, and crustaceans) (Maruzzo et al. 2005) suggesting that metamorphic transformation al- ters the cellular response to injury. How exactly these onto- genetic shifts affect the regulatory control of regeneration is poorly understood. Metamorphosis represents the postembryonic transforma- tion of tissues and physiological systems as larva abruptly transition to juveniles. In amphibians, these spectacular changes are stimulated by thyroxine which binds thyroid hor- mone receptors attached to DNA and activates latent devel- opmental programs in target tissues (Buchholz et al. 2006). Studies in frogs and salamanders have produced two seem- ingly opposing viewpoints regarding the effect of metamor- phosis on regenerative ability in these groups (Wallace 1981). On the one hand, studies in frogs provide a clear picture that progressive loss of regenerative ability in the limb is a conse- quence of morphological, cellular, and genomic changes that occur during metamorphosis. First, there is a stage dependent loss of regenerative ability approaching metamorphic climax (Forsyth 1946; Dent 1962; Muneoka et al. 1986). Second, the larval skin matures to a terrestrial form, striated mus- cle forms, and the skeleton begins to differentiate. As these changes occur, there is a correlated proximal to distal loss of regenerative capacity (Rose 1944; Forsyth 1946; Korneluk and Liversage 1984; Wolfe et al. 2000). Lastly, there is some evidence that metamorphic transformation inhibits gene tran- scription required for regeneration either directly or through alteration in the epigenetic landscape (Christen and Slack 1997; Yokoyama et al. 2000; Christen et al. 2003; Yakushiji et al. 2007). Thus, developmental changes during metamor- phosis drastically reduce regenerative ability in anurans. In contrast, the prevailing viewpoint for urodeles is that re- generative ability is essentially independent of metamorpho- sis, as some urodele species can regenerate as adults. Indeed, examination of four species of adult ambystomids found that, under the proper environmental conditions, complete limb regeneration was possible, albeit at a slower rate compared with larval forms (Young et al. 1983a,b). Similarly, most experiments performed with aquatic phaseNotopthalamus viridescensreport perfect regeneration (Wallace 1981). On the other hand, there are contradictory reports of incomplete and abnormal regeneration in species ofTriturus,Salaman- dra,andPleurodeles(Scadding 1977, 1981; Wallace 1981), and repeated amputations inN. viridescensproduce skeletal anomalies (Dearlove and Dresden 1976). Moreover, when limb regeneration was assessed inPleurodeles waltlbefore, during, and after metamorphosis, the result was a clear re- duction in regenerative capability as measured by both an increase in digit loss and reduction in the rate of regeneration (Wallace 1981). Whilst these discrepancies may have a phy- logenetic explanation, they might also result from age and body size differences in post-metamorphic animals (Seifert et al. 2012a). While much has been learned from tadpoles and pre- and post-metamorphic urodeles, each system presents sev- eral fundamental limitations that hinder inferences about the direct influence of metamorphosis. First, in tadpoles, when regenerative ability is lost in a stage-specific manner (i.e., ap- proaching or during metamorphosis) it precisely correlates with the degree of cellular differentiation in the develop- ing limb bud (Muneoka et al. 1986). In fact, some inves- tigators have termed the regenerative response inXenopus and other frogsembryonic regulation.

Trophic island biogeography theory predicts that the effects of predators on prey diversity are context dependent in heterogeneous landscapes. Specifically, models predict that the positive effect of habitat area on prey diversity should decline in the presence of predators, and that predators should modify the partitioning of alpha and beta diversity across patchy landscapes. However, experimental tests of the predicted context dependency in top-down control remain limited. Using a factorial field experiment we quantify the effects of a focal predatory fish species (grouper) and habitat characteristics (patch size, fragmentation) on the partitioning of diversity and assembly of coral reef fish communities. We found independent effects of groupers and patch characteristics on prey communities. Groupers reduced prey abundance by 50%and gamma diversity by 45%, with a disproportionate removal of rare species relative to common species (64%and 36%reduction, respectively; an oddity effect).

INTRODUCTION Recent theoretical studies have merged concepts from food web ecology and biogeography to gain insight into how the trophic composition of communities and the strength of species interactions shift across heteroge- neous landscapes. These efforts have yielded several predictions. First, characteristic differences between trophic levels in factors such as resource requirements (Holt et al. 1999), trophic generalization (Gravel et al. 2011), dispersal ability (Chase et al. 2010), or sensitivity to demographic stochasticity (Holt 2010) can cause predators and prey to respond differently to shifts in patch size and isolation (Holt 2010, Gravel et al. 2011). Second, models and observational studies (Ryberg and Chase 2007, Holt 2010, Ryberg et al. 2012) suggest that the capacity of predators to increase prey extinction can mitigate the positive effects of habitat area on species diversity (i.e., the species–area relationship). This can produce different species–area relationships in the presence and absence of predators and modify the partitioning of alpha and beta diversity in patchy landscapes. Here we focus on this latter issue and explore whether the top-down effect of predators on prey communities varies with patch size and modifies the partitioning of prey diversity. Ignoring trophic interactions, three main processes underlie positive correlations between habitat area and biodiversity: (1) sampling effects (i.e., larger areas require more sampling effort which leads to more species collected [Connor and McCoy 1979]); (2) environmental heterogeneity (i.e., larger areas support more habitat types and thus support more species); and (3) demographic effects (i.e., habitat area influences colonization, extinction, and dispersal [reviewed in Rosenzweig 1995, Drakare et al. 2006]). With respect to demographic effects, trophic biogeography theory focuses solely on the role of predators in affecting prey Manuscript received 3 October 2012; revised 1 October 2013; accepted 16 October 2013.

For example, an extension of the Equilibrium Theory of Island Biogeography by Ryberg and Chase (2007) and a generalization by Holt (2010) predict that predators affect the slope of the species–area relationship (Z) for prey. Whether predators increase or decrease the slope of the prey species–area relationship is dependent upon the foraging strategy of a predator and whether this behavior varies consistently with habitat area. If the effect of predation is dependent upon habitat area, then, depending on whether predators increase or decrease prey diversity, the additive extinction will either magnify or attenuate the reduced extinctions with increasing habitat area. If predators increase diversity by dispro- portionately consuming dominant competitors (i.e., keystone predation [Power et al. 1996]), frequency- dependent predation (i.e., Janzen-Connell effects [Jan- zen 1970, Connell 1971]), or prey switching (Murdoch 1969, Abrams and Matsuda 1996), then patches with predators should have higherZvalues (i.e., species–area relationships with steeper slopes) because predators are decreasing prey extinction rates. Alternatively, if pred- ators reduce diversity by either making species suscep- tible to demographic stochasticity (Sih et al. 1985), disproportionately consuming rare prey (Spiller and Schoener 1998), or reducing abundances of all species (Almany and Webster 2004), then patches with preda- tors should have higher extinction rates, thereby producing lowerZvalues (i.e., shallower species–area relationships) relative to patches with no predators (Holt 2010). In addition to predictingZvalues, trophic biogeog- raphy theory also predicts the effect of predators on diversity partitioning within and among patches. His- torically, researchers have focused on the effect of predators on alpha diversity, but recent theory makes explicit predictions about the role of predators in diversity partitioning. Specifically, assuming an additive diversity partitioning (aþb¼c), Ryberg et al. (2012) showed that generalist predators can increase prey extinction rates, which can lead to a decrease in alpha diversity (a) and a corresponding increase in beta diversity (b). Furthermore, their model demonstrates that when predators reduce gamma diversity (c) by acting as environmental filters and homogenizing diversity across patches (e.g., through eliminating prey that are poorly morphologically or chemically defend- ed), reduced alpha and beta diversity can result in reduced gamma diversity. Additionally, predators often reduce community size, and metacommunity theory predicts that reductions in community size should increase beta diversity (Orrock and Fletcher 2005, Orrock and Watling 2010). Specifically, Orrock and Watling (2010) used a competition–colonization model to show that reductions in community size can increase the probability that superior competitors are lost from a given patch due to ecological drift. Therefore, when communities are small, landscapes will likely exhibit high beta diversity driven by stochastic colonization by different species, relative to a landscape with larger communities where a single competitively dominant species will homogenize the landscape by competitively excluding inferior species. Empirical studies support the hypothesis that predators can affect partitioning of alpha and beta diversity through acting as environmen- tal filters and homogenizing diversity across patches (Chase et al. 2009), and by modifying the strength of priority effects (Chase et al. 2009, Stier et al. 2013b). Trophic biogeography captures only a subset of the possible ways in which predators can interact with habitat characteristics and drive the partitioning of diversity across patchy landscapes. For example, larger habitats often contain greater environmental heteroge- neity (i.e., niche availability), a factor known to mediate predation–competition interactions (Werner et al. 1983). Trophic biogeography additionally ignores other habitat characteristics known to mediate predator–prey dynam- ics (e.g., spatial habitat heterogeneity [Huffaker 1958, Crowley 1978], refuge availability [Diehl 1993], habitat complexity [reviewed in Jeffries and Lawton 1984], and fragmentation [reviewed in Ryall and Fahrig 2006]) that often covary with habitat area. Advances in trophic biogeography theory willrequire tests of existing theoretical predictions focused on predation–habitat area effects, as well as theoretical and empirical extension of the theory to include interactions between predation and habitat characteristics such as spatial heterogeneity, refuge availability, and fragmentation. Here, we quantify the independent and combined effects of predation and two habitat characteristics, patch size and patch fragmentation, on community organization of coral reef fish communities. We begin by using field surveys to examine the natural distributions of fishes and explore whether predators affect ch",

Stier 1,2,3, *, Andrew M. Hein 3,4, *, Valeriano Parravicini 5,6,7 & Michel Kulbicki 6 Top predators are a critical part of healthy ecosystems. Yet, these species are often absent from spatially isolated habitats leading to the pervasive view that fragmented ecological communities collapse from the top down. Here we study reef fish from coral reef commu- nities across the Pacific Ocean. Our analysis shows that species richness of reef fish top predators is relatively stable across habitats that vary widely in spatial isolation and total species richness. In contrast, species richness of prey reef fish declines rapidly with increasing isolation. By consequence, species-poor communities from isolated islands have three times as many predator species per prey species as near-shore communities. We develop and test a colonization–extinction model to reveal how larval dispersal patterns shape this ocean-scale gradient in trophic structure.

T op predators are often conspicuously absent from isolated habitats 1–8 . Explanations for such spatial variation in trophic structure are numerous: predators often have greater resource requirements 9–11 , larger body sizes 12 , smaller population sizes 13 and slower population growth rates 14 than species lower in the food web. Moreover, in some ecosystems, predators are poorer dispersers than their prey, making it less likely that they will colonize isolated habitats, let alone persist there 1,15 . In marine systems, however, genetic estimates of dispersal distances provide some evidence that species higher in the food web disperse more widely than species in lower trophic levels 16 . If predators disperse widely, serial influx of colonists could rescue isolated predator populations from extinction. An immediate question, then, is how do differences in the dispersal patterns of predators and their prey affect geographic patterns of community trophic structure? To answer this question, we analysed a database of published species lists from 35 major coral reef fish communities across the Pacific Ocean consisting of 1,350 total species. Using diet and life history information, we classified each species as either a piscivorous top predator (hereafter predator) or as a species lower on the food chain (hereafter prey). The ratio of the number of predator species to the number of prey species (predator–prey ratio 17 ,R; Fig. 1, circle colour) and total reef fish species richness (circle size) vary widely among Pacific coral reef communities. Total reef fish species richness decreases with increasing isolation as in other systems 18,19 and predator–prey ratio varies among islands by a factor of 3 (range: 0.34–1.1 predator species per prey species; Fig. 1). However, in stark contrast to patterns reported from other ecosystems 20 , the coral reef communities with the highest predator–prey ratios are species-poor communities from the most isolated habitats (for example, Midway, Tuvalu; Fig. 1 inset), whereas communities located near large landmasses (for example, Palau, Vanuatu) have high total species richness and low predator–prey ratios. Two features of Pacific coral reef communities are at odds with theory and observations from other systems. First, predator–prey ratio is high in isolated communities and low in proximate ones. Second, predator–prey ratio is negatively correlated with total reef fish species richness (Fig. 1, inset) instead of being positively correlated with, or invariant of total richness as in many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems 20 . These findings contradict theoretical predictions 13,21 and empirical studies of other ecosystems, which suggest that species highest in the food web should be most sensitive to habitat isolation 4,10,12,22 . Here we develop a mathematical dispersal–colonization–extinction framework that resolves both of these discrepancies. The framework models species composition in a given habitat as an equilibrium between colonization of new species and extinction of those already present 23 , but builds on this concept by incorporating a basic life history trait of reef fish, the duration of pelagic (open ocean) larval dispersal, which can influence species’ dispersal distances 24 . We model larval dispersal to predict colonization rate at focal reefs, and use colonization rate to predict how species richness and predator–prey ratio vary across space. Results Modelling framework. Most reef fishes exhibit a multi-stage lifecycle involving a dispersive larval stage, followed by a non- dispersive adult stage. The length of time larvae spend in the dispersive stage is known as pelagic larval duration (PLD). Limited dispersal due to limited PLD has been proposed to explain why total reef fish species richness is lower in more isolated habitats and why species that do occur in isolated habitats have higher mean PLD than those inhabiting near-shore habitats 18,25 . In general, short-term estimates of dispersal distance are positively correlated with PLD among marine species, although the strength of this relationship varies across the range of PLDs 26 . In this study, we are most interested in dispersal that allows species to colonize new habitats over long ecological timescales (that is, hundreds to thousands of fish generations). Genetic estimates of dispersal distances may provide the best available indices of dispersal distance on such timescales. Genetic estimates of dispersal distance are strongly correlated with PLD, and also agree reasonably well with dispersal distance estimates from computational Lagrangian particle models, which assume that marine larvae disperse like passive particles through the plankton 24 . Here we take an analytical approach that includes PLD along with other basic features of the larval dispersal process. To relate PLD to dispersal and colonization rates of predators and prey, we use a diffusion–advection–mortality model 27 , which describes dispersal of fish larvae from large source populations (Figs 2,3; full model described in Supplementary Methods).

The ratio of predator larvae to prey larvae colonizing a site will increase with increasing habitat isolation if predators spend more time drifting in the plankton than their prey (that is,t pred 4t prey ). This is because a longer PLD causes predator larvae to spread farther from their point of release (Fig. 3), creating a distribution of predator larvae that is spread more uniformly over space than the distribution of prey larvae (Supplementary Methods section 4.1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 discuss multiple larval sources). Data from 382 species of Indo– Pacific reef-associated fish from a recently published database 28 (Supplementary Data 1;nprey¼347,npredators¼35) indicate that mean predator PLD is 28% longer than mean prey PLD (Fig. 2a). Equation (1) therefore predicts that the ratio of predator to prey colonization rates should increase with increasing habitat isolation. To connect colonization rates with standing species richness and predator–prey ratio, we use a colonization–extinction model 23 (Fig. 2b,c). In keeping with classical models 13 , we assume that species within each trophic level colonize and go extinct from habitats identically and independently. We calculate the predator–prey ratioRin a focal habitat as the ratio of the equilibrium number of predator species (S pred ) to the equilibrium number of prey species (S prey ),R¼ S pred S prey / p & pred p & prey , where p & pred andp & prey are the equilibrium probabilities that any given predator or prey species occur in the community (Supplementary Methods).

Our approach provides a general template to evaluate ecosystem trade-offs between stage-specific harvest practices in relation to environmental variability, the risk of fishery closures, and the risk of exceeding ecosystem thresholds intended to ensure conservation goals are met. H arvesting natural populations has both intended and unintended consequences. The intended conse- quences result from the extraction of biomass from an ecosystem for use by people; timber, wild seafood, and game serve as familiar examples. The unintended consequences of harvest, however, are highly variable and can include evolutionary shifts in populations, habitat modification, incidental mortality of non- target species, altered food web interactions, and changes in ecosystem functions and services 1,2 . This potential for far-reaching problems underlies emerging enthusiasm for ecosystem-based management, which is predicated on addressing connections between people’s activities, species, and ecosystems 3,4 . It also overlooks the more imme- diate, and often unresolved, danger of managing conflicts that can arise due to the cumulative impacts of multiple human influences on a single species 5 . If activities cannot be successfully coordinated within any single use sector, it would seem exceedingly ambitious to expect that activities might be coordinated across sectors 6 . Individual species prosecuted by multiple fisheries provide an interesting case in point. There are many stocks worldwide that are exploited by more than one fishing gear, in more than one season, and/or during more than one life stage. From an ecological perspective, harvest of stage-structured populations increases the complexity of dynamics 7 . Dozens of fishes are prized both for their roe (eggs) and for the protein derived from adult life stages (e.g. salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.); herring (Clupea spp.), sturgeon (Acipenseridae), shad (Alosa spp.)). Several aquatic reptiles and birds are exploited both for their eggs and for the meat derived from adult life stages (e.g., turtles, alligators, gulls). The consequences of such stage-specific exploitation may lead to non-equivalent effects of alternate management strategies on the target species (e.g. 8 ). Harvesting young, pre-reproductive individuals will generally result in qualitatively different population dynamics than harvesting mature adults 9,10 . This non-equivalency can produce trade-offs that influence both the ecosystem service of (sea)food provisioning and the socio-economic status of fishers and fishing communities. Surprisingly, there are many stocks lacking coordination of harvest strategies among fisheries affecting different life stages 11,12 , perhaps because the fisheries occur in different geographies, at different times of year, or both. This lack of coordination is one factor underlying calls to move toward ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM 2 ;). Adding to this rationale, the potential for trade-offs among fisheries targeting the same stock at different life stages is complicated by a third axis of conservation importance: the persistence of the exploited OPEN SUBJECT AREAS: CONSERVATION POPULATION DYNAMICS Received 12 September 2014 Accepted 30 October 2014 Published 19 November 2014 Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to A.O.S.

Recent publications have focused on conservation motivated by the intrinsic value of species, and the moral imperative to avoid extinctions 13–16 . Thus removal of fish biomass by fisheries can threaten this conservation aim if it proceeds too close to full deple- tion of any individual stock. In addition, and as importantly, policy directives around the world (e.g. 17,18 ,) now include conservation- oriented goals for EBFM that acknowledge incidental effects of fish- ing on the predators and prey of exploited stocks. Marine forage fish provide a focal point for these issues because of the ecosystem implications of their harvest 19 . Forage fish are small to intermediate-sized pelagic species (e.g. sardine, anchovy, sprat, her- ring, capelin, krill, squid) that serve as the chief link between the lower trophic levels on which they feed (zooplankton and phyto- plankton) and the upper trophic level predators (mammals, birds, larger fishes) that rely upon them as a primary food source 20 . They also tend to be characterized by dramatically fluctuating popula- tions 21,22 with the preponderance of the evidence indicating that stochastic environmental forcing plays a strong role 23–25 . It has been argued that the value of forage fish to other fisheries can be quite large (e.g. 26 ), including a recent global estimate that they are worth twice as much as fisheries directed at forage fish themselves 20 . Furthermore, recent attempts to quantify the importance of forage fish to non- exploited species such as seabirds suggest that forage fish biomass should be maintained at levels higher than typically set as part of fisheries harvest guidelines 22,27 , though such ecosystem thresholds for forage fisheries have not yet been widely adopted. Less effort has been devoted to evaluating how such ecosystem constraints may trade-off with fishery priorities at a spatial scale relevant to forage fish management. Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), a forage fish species occurring in the North Pacific, are emblematic of the need to understand the population dynamic consequences of alternative forms of exploita- tion in order to achieve sustainable fisheries and conservation goals. Off the coast of British Columbia and Alaska, Pacific herring are subject to at least two distinct fisheries: one that catches mature spawning adults and one that harvests (immature) eggs. Ecological principles suggest that the two fisheries have distinct influences on herring dynamics, but the interaction between multiple fisheries and ecosystem considerations is largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop a stochastic, age-structured model to investigate the conse- quences of egg- and adult-harvest for population dynamics, fisheries, and conservation. In particular, we focus attention on how different combinations of harvest intensity affect herring biomass (in relation to both species-specific and ecosystem thresholds), the catch of adult herring and eggs, and the frequency of fishery closures. Our approach provides a template to evaluate trade-offs between egg- and adult-harvest rates in relation to environmental variability, risk to fisheries in terms of the probability of fishery closures, and the risk to ecosystems based on the dietary needs of predators reliant upon exploited stocks. Results Herring population dynamics are strongly influenced by fishing (Fig. 1a, 1b) and recruitment regimes (Fig. 1c, 1d). We present results for simulations that assume a moderate level of recruitment variabil- ity (coefficient of variation,CV50.8, lag-one autocorrelation,r5 0.5); results under alternate simulation recruitment scenarios are provided in the Supplementary materials. Annual harvest of both adults and eggs each can strongly affect herring spawning biomass (Fig. 2). Increasing either adult or egg harvest results in decreased mean biomass during the 40 year span of the simulation; however, populations show distinct responses to harvest on eggs relative to harvest on adults. Increasing harvest on adults,h adult , causes a rapid decline in mean spawning biomass – high harvest rates on adults (h adult .<0.50) can result in mean biomass below the fishery closure limitB lim (,5,900 mt, Table 1). In contrast, harvest on eggs,h egg , by itself has a more limited effect on mean biomass until the annual proportion harvested,h egg ,.0.70; indeed, untilh egg .0.90 mean biomass always exceeds 10,000 mt. The cooefficient of variation of biomass,CV SSB , is relatively stable across harvesting scenarios (generally 0.5,CV SSB ,0.75). The only exception is an area in whichCV,0.5 that corresponds to high adult harvest rates or high egg harvest and moderate to high adult harvest in which the population fluctuates very nearB lim (Fig. 2b). There is a strong and asymmetric trade-off between the catch of adults and catch of eggs (Fig. 3a, 3b). Overall, high egg harvest rates do not allow for high adult catch and vice versa. Mean catch of eggs is maximized at a very high proportional harvest rate (h egg <0.7) while adult harvest rate is maximized ath adult <0.60. However the inter- action be",

Yet, we know relatively little about the ecological processes that contribute to the diversity, dynamics, and persistence of these more cryptic reef communities. Studies in temperate systems point to pre- dation as a key processes promoting marine community dynamics (i.e., Keystone Predation, Paine1966), and some evidence suggests an increase in the strength of predation at lower latitudes may contribute to high tropical diversity (Pianka1966; Schemske et al.2009; Freestone et al.2010). However, empirical evidence supporting the positive effects of predators on tropical diversity is mixed. For example, predators can reduce coral and fish diversity by disproportionately consuming rare prey (Chesher1969; Glynn1976; Almany and Webster2004). In contrast, predation can also increase diversity. For example, Stier et al. (2013b) showed that predatory fish can increase prey fish diversity by promoting priority effects (Stier et al. 2013b). Additionally, Marhaver et al. (2012) showed that species-specific microbes promote coral diversity through negative frequency-dependent predation on coral recruits (i.e., a Janzen-Connell effect Janzen1970; Connell1971). However, studies examining the effects of predation on tropical marine diversity have been taxonomically biased toward conspicuous and economically valuable corals and fishes. These groups make up only a fraction of tropical marine biodiversity, which is heavily dominated by more cryptic invertebrate species (Stella et al.2011). Indeed, a survey quantifying the taxonomic breadth of species stud- ied in kelp forests, mangroves, seagrasses, and coral reefs found that species studied in coral reefs have the lowest taxonomic breadth across these four systems (Fisher et al. 2011). Such poor taxonomic coverage in studies of coral reefs restricts our understanding of a major component of tropical biodiversity and may therefore limit our appreci- ation of the drivers of ecosystem function. In this study, we focus on decapod crustaceans and small-bodied fish that live within corals of the South Pacific. Decapod remains litter the reef and are commonly found in fish stomach dissections (Kulbicki et al.2005; Enochs and Manzello 2012; Kramer et al.2012; Leray et al.2012a,b,2013), suggesting that crustaceans are major nodes in a vibrant web of tropical marine trophic interactions and that pre- dation may be a key process driving decapod dynamics. In addition to being a diverse yet underrepresented group in the ecological literature on tropical marine bio- diversity, tropical decapods are also relevant, because a subset of decapod species play a crucial role in the resil- ience of their coral host. Certain species ofTrapeziaand Alpheuspromote coral growth and survival by alleviating stressors such as seastar predation (Glynn1983; Pratchett 2001), sedimentation (Stewart et al.2006), and mucus- producing snails (Stier et al.2010). Furthermore, these decapods often co-occur with damselfishes that indirectly promote coral growth through oxygenation (Goldshmid et al.2004) and nutrient subsidy (Meyer and Schultz1985; Liberman et al. 1995; Holbrook et al.2008,2011). The beneficial effects of mutualists on their host are often dependent on mutualist density and identity (Holland et al. 2002); previous studies show increased coral performance with increased density of and diversity of decapods (McKeon et al.2012; Stier et al.2012) and increased density of damselfish (Holbrook et al.2008). The benefits each mutualist species provides are also highly dependent upon the fish and decapod identity (Holbrook et al.2011; McKeon et al.2012; Stier et al.2012). Therefore, if pre- dation affects the density, diversity, and composition of coral mutualists or if different predator species differen- tially affect certain mutualist species, then, the perfor- mance and resilience of the coral host may be fundamentally altered by predator presence, density, or identity (Knight et al.2006; Romero et al.2011). Here, we quantify the effect of predation in driving the abundance, diversity, and composition of decapods and fishes that live cryptically embedded between the branches ofP. eydouxi, a dominant, structurally complex, reef- building coral distributed widely across the South Pacific. Our study combines (1) a survey to explore the spatial distribution of our two focal predators: the coral croucher (Scorpaenidae;Caracanthus maculatus) and the flame hawkfish (Cirrhitidae;Neocirrhites armatus) and (2) a recruitment experiment to examine the independent and combined effects of each predator species onP. eydouxi- associated communities. We show that both flame hawkfish and coral crouchers substantially alter fish and crustacean community organization, and we discuss the implications of shifts in community structure for coral growth and resilience. Materials and methods Study site and species We conducted our study in the lagoon of Opunohu bay on the North shore of Moorea, French Polynesia (17°30 0 S, 149°50 0 W). Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems, and tens to hundreds of species can co-occur on a single coral colony (Grassle1973; Lassig1977; Castro1988; Leray et al.2012b). One such coral host is the coral genus Pocillopora, which is an important reef-building coral distributed widely across the Indo-Pacific. Multiple trophic levels of fishes and invertebrates live among the branches ofPocillopora,which provides structural habitat for sev- eral co-occurring carnivorous fishes and a wide diversity of 182Coral Reefs (2014) 33:181–191 123 potential invertebrate prey (*80 % decapods, Odinetz 1983). We focused on the two most common predatory fishes that are strictly associated with pocilloporid corals and co-occur in coral heads at shallow depths: the flame hawkfish (Neocirrhites armatus) and the coral croucher (Caracanthus maculatus) (Randall2005). Both coral crouchers and flame hawkfish are ambush predators that restrict their movement to the inside of the coral host. Thus, both predators and prey share structural refuge from larger predators (a common phenomena in many predator–prey systems, Gotelli and Ellison2006), causing predators to live in close proximity with a diversity of coral-associated decapod prey species. The two focal predators exhibit slight differences in microhabitat use; coral crouchers remain deep among the coral branches, while the flame hawkfish are more mobile. These two predators primarily comprised of crustaceans and also includes gastropods and fishes (mo",

Furthermore, these decapods often co-occur with damselfishes that indirectly promote coral growth through oxygenation (Goldshmid et al.2004) and nutrient subsidy (Meyer and Schultz1985; Liberman et al. 1995; Holbrook et al.2008,2011). The beneficial effects of mutualists on their host are often dependent on mutualist density and identity (Holland et al. 2002); previous studies show increased coral performance with increased density of and diversity of decapods (McKeon et al.2012; Stier et al.2012) and increased density of damselfish (Holbrook et al.2008). The benefits each mutualist species provides are also highly dependent upon the fish and decapod identity (Holbrook et al.2011; McKeon et al.2012; Stier et al.2012). Therefore, if pre- dation affects the density, diversity, and composition of coral mutualists or if different predator species differen- tially affect certain mutualist species, then, the perfor- mance and resilience of the coral host may be fundamentally altered by predator presence, density, or identity (Knight et al.2006; Romero et al.2011). Here, we quantify the effect of predation in driving the abundance, diversity, and composition of decapods and fishes that live cryptically embedded between the branches ofP. eydouxi, a dominant, structurally complex, reef- building coral distributed widely across the South Pacific. Our study combines (1) a survey to explore the spatial distribution of our two focal predators: the coral croucher (Scorpaenidae;Caracanthus maculatus) and the flame hawkfish (Cirrhitidae;Neocirrhites armatus) and (2) a recruitment experiment to examine the independent and combined effects of each predator species onP. eydouxi- associated communities. We show that both flame hawkfish and coral crouchers substantially alter fish and crustacean community organization, and we discuss the implications of shifts in community structure for coral growth and resilience. Materials and methods Study site and species We conducted our study in the lagoon of Opunohu bay on the North shore of Moorea, French Polynesia (17°30 0 S, 149°50 0 W). Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems, and tens to hundreds of species can co-occur on a single coral colony (Grassle1973; Lassig1977; Castro1988; Leray et al.2012b). One such coral host is the coral genus Pocillopora, which is an important reef-building coral distributed widely across the Indo-Pacific. Multiple trophic levels of fishes and invertebrates live among the branches ofPocillopora,which provides structural habitat for sev- eral co-occurring carnivorous fishes and a wide diversity of 182Coral Reefs (2014) 33:181–191 123 potential invertebrate prey (*80 % decapods, Odinetz 1983). We focused on the two most common predatory fishes that are strictly associated with pocilloporid corals and co-occur in coral heads at shallow depths: the flame hawkfish (Neocirrhites armatus) and the coral croucher (Caracanthus maculatus) (Randall2005). Both coral crouchers and flame hawkfish are ambush predators that restrict their movement to the inside of the coral host. Thus, both predators and prey share structural refuge from larger predators (a common phenomena in many predator–prey systems, Gotelli and Ellison2006), causing predators to live in close proximity with a diversity of coral-associated decapod prey species. The two focal predators exhibit slight differences in microhabitat use; coral crouchers remain deep among the coral branches, while the flame hawkfish are more mobile. These two predators primarily comprised of crustaceans and also includes gastropods and fishes (mo",

Most empirical studies of predation use simple experimental approaches to quantify the effects of predators on prey (e.g., using constant densities of predators, such as ambient vs. zero). However, predator densities vary in time, and these effects may not be well represented by studies that use constant predator densities. Although studies have independently examined the importance of predator density, temporal variability, and timing of arrival (i.e., early or late relative to prey), the relative contribution of these different predator regimes on prey abundance, diversity, and composition remains poorly understood. The hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus), a carnivorous coral reef fish, exhibits substantial variability in patch occupancy, density, and timing of arrival to natural reefs. Our field experiments demonstrated that effects of hawkfish on prey abundance depended on both hawkfish density and the timing of their arrival, but not on variability in hawkfish density. Relative to treatments without hawkfish, hawkfish presence reduced prey abundance by 50%. This effect increased with a doubling of hawkfish density (an additional 33%reduction), and when hawkfish arrived later during community development (a 34%reduction). Hawkfish did not affect within-patch diversity (species richness), but they increased between-patch diversity (beta) based on species incidence (22%), and caused shifts in species composition. Our results suggest that the timing of predator arrival can be as important as predator density in modifying prey abundance and community composition.

INTRODUCTION Predator migration, mortality, and recruitment can lead to temporal variability in predator density, creating a habitat landscape consisting of a mosaic of patches with differing patterns of predator occupancy, mean density, and timing of arrival (relative to prey). Such an assortment of predator patch occupancies may substan- tially alter the strength of predation, creating distinct patterns of prey abundance, diversity, and composition. Of the numerous studies identifying predation as a key process in prey coexistence, relative abundance, and composition (e.g., Sih et al. 1985, Spiller and Schoener 1998), the majority focus on effects of chronic predator exposure at a constant level (i.e., presence–absence or a gradient of predator densities). Variability in ecological processes has historically been considered noise; however, more recently, empir- ical studies of predation (Butler 1989, Navarrete 1996), stress (Benedetti-Cecchi et al. 2006), disturbance (Bish- op and Kelaher 2007), phenotypic plasticity (Miner and Vonesh 2004), and plant–herbivore interactions (Atalah et al. 2007) have documented the emergent effects of spatial and temporal variability. These effects of variance are usually explained by Jensen’s inequality: if f(x) is nonlinear, then the mean of the function is not equal to the function evaluated at the mean ( fðxÞ6¼f( ̄ x). Thus, studies that use a mean predator density (i.e., which focus onf( ̄ x)) will not describe the effect of predators when there is substantial variation aroundf( ̄ x) (see Ruel and Ayres 1999, Inouye 2005). Ecologically, there are many reasons to expect effects of predator density on prey to be nonlinear (Skalski and Gilliam 2001). Temporal variability in predator densities can reduce the strength of the effect of predators by shifting the availability of spatial or temporal refuges for prey. For example, Butler (1989) showed that temporally variable sunfish predation can produce unique macro- invertebrate communities in freshwater lakes relative to communities exposed to chronic sunfish predation. In intertidal invertebrate communities, Navarrete (1996) found that variable densities of whelks (the predator) Manuscript received 4 November 2011; revised 12 October 2012; accepted 22 October 2012; final version received 14 November 2012.

E-mail: adrian.stier@gmail.com 1057 allowed some prey to survive and grow while the whelk was absent and achieve a size refuge when the whelk was later present. This escape from predation modified competitive dynamics and altered the prey community. In addition to the effects of predator variance in affecting community organization, timing of predator arrival, especially relative to the timing of prey, can also modify the role of predation in community assembly by modifying priority effects (Morin 1984, Louette and De Meester 2007, Hoverman and Relyea 2008), succession (Olito and Fukami 2009), and alternative stable states (Price and Morin 2004). Predators may starve if they arrive in communities before prey, thereby alleviating predation pressure when prey do arrive. Alternatively, when predator and prey arrival times overlap, early predators may have the strongest effects, because prey will have insufficient time to reach size refugia, develop morphological or chemical defenses, or gain knowledge of predator-free space. Similarly, in size-structured systems, predators and prey may compete early in ontogeny, so early-arriving predators may avoid a competitive bottleneck (Olson et al. 1995). Reef fish communities are ideal for examining comparative effects of predator density, temporal variability in predation pressure, and timing of predator arrival relative to prey. Piscivores on reefs affect the abundance and diversity of prey (Hixon 1991, Hixon and Beets 1993, Almany and Webster 2006), and exhibit extensive spatio-temporal variability in abundance (Doherty 1991, Connell and Kingsford 1998, Dahlgren and Eggleston 2000). Here, we documented spatial and temporal variation in a predatory reef fish, the hawkfish Paracirrhites arcatus(hereafter hawkfish), on natural reefs. Then, we used a field experiment to evaluate the independent and combined effects of predator density, variation in predator density, and timing of predator arrival on abundance and diversity of fish communities. M ETHODS Study system, site, and species The island of Moorea (French Polynesia: 17830 0 S, 149850 0 W) is surrounded by a barrier reef with a shallow lagoon that ranges from 0.8–1.3 km wide, and is ;3–7 m deep (Galzin and Pointer 1985). The lagoon is interspersed with patch reefs within a matrix of sand, fine coral rubble, and coral pavement (Galzin and Pointer 1985), with individual patch reefs separated by less than a meter, to tens of meters. Hawkfish are a common, diurnal, sit-and-wait carnivore found perched upon the branches ofAcroporaspp. andPocilloporaspp. coral within the lagoon. Their diet includes recently settled fishes, shrimps, and other crustaceans (M. Leray, personal communication). Quantifying temporal patch occupancy of hawkfish To quantify natural variability in hawkfish density, we visually censused the abundance of hawkfish on 192 small patch reefs (area¼4.0261.67 m 2 , mean6SD) approximately twice per week from February to June 2005 (126 samples). We found hawkfish on 66 of the 192 surveyed patch reefs; we focus our analysis on 55 of the 66 reefs where hawkfish were observed at least twice. To summarize overall occupancy we calculated the average number of hawkfish per reef. Per reef, hawkfish were observed an average of 13.367.7 days of the 126 census days; density ranged from 1 to 5 hawkfish per patch reef (when hawkfish were present: 1.2260.27 hawkfish, mean61 SD; Fig. 1b). The 55 reefs were occupied 47% 627%of the 126 census days with a coefficient of variation of 1.48%60.94%(mean61 SD). To compute patterns of occupancy, we interpolated between obser- vations, assuming that hawkfish were continuously present between observations where they were present, continuously absent between observations where they FIG. 1. Summary of surveys of 192 patch reefs on the northern shore of Moorea, Society Islands, from February to June 2005 (approximately two times per week). (a) Frequency distribution of mean (right-censored) duration of hawkfish occupancy events on surveyed reefs. Occupancy events were defined as consecutive survey observations of hawkfish presence on a reef (maximum time between survey observations¼4 days). The duration of each occupancy event is the number of consecutive days of hawkfish presence, assuming that hawkfish were present on days between consecutive sightings. Note that our surveys did not allow us to discern among individual hawkfish; therefore, in some instances individual fish may have been lost and replaced by a new, similar-sized immigrant between census points. The mean duration of occupancy is the average duration of all occupancy events recorded for a given reef. (b) Time-averaged density of hawkfish from surveys of 192 patch reefs in Moorea. ADRIAN C.

Apex predators are particularly vulnerable to these stressors due to their low natural abundances and life- history characteristics (e.g., slow growth, late age of maturity, and low fecundity)[5]. Thus, even with increased fisheries regulations and improved management practices preservation and restora- tion of top predator populations is inherently challenging. The global loss of sharks has intensified in recent decades as a result of incidental catch (or bycatch) in other economically valuable fisheries (i.e., tuna and billfish), and targeted shark fishing[6]. Fishermen target sharks in part due to a growing demand for shark fins in Asian markets and, on a smaller scale, for the meat[7,8]. Shark finning involves catching and removing the dorsal, pelvic and pectoral fins from a live shark, which is then thrown back into the ocean to perish. The resulting fins are dried and exported to Asian markets and other trade ‘‘hubs’’ for their eventual use in shark fin soup[8–10]. Both shark finning and catching sharks for the shark fin trade are lucrative practices for fishermen due to the rapid economic growth in China[8], whereby the recent growth of the middle-class has increased demand for shark fin soup because more people can afford the dish[11]. Recent estimates suggest that the total shark biomass in the global shark fin trade could be up to 1.70 million tons, ranging between 26–73 million sharks annually[8]. The high economic incentives coupled with a lack of enforcement in restricted areas due to limited personnel and high costs asso- ciated with patrolling large geographic expanses result in unre- gulated shark fishing globally[12]. Illegal shark fishing has been documented in areas of high biodiversity, and within marine protected areas and no-take zones[11,13,14]. 1.1.

Marine Policy 39 (2013) 317–321 shark species documented in Ecuadorian waters (including the GMR), and 30 of these species are frequently caught by fisher- men[11]. All of the most commonly caught species are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, a comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of biological species, and are considered as Near Threatened or Vulnerable. Near Threatened refers to species likely to become endangered in the near future, and Vulnerable describes species with a high risk of endangerment in the wild[15]. While some sharks in Ecuador are caught and sold for meat, most are targeted for their fins[11]. Shark fins are exported from mainland Ecuador to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore[11]. While the shark fin trade has existed on mainland Ecuador since the early 1960s, large-scale industrial shark finning in the Gala ́ pagos Islands began in the early 1950s[11]. Although the Gala ́ pagos Islands were designated as a marine reserve in 1986 this decree did not carry national protected area status, making management and enforcement of exploitation impossible. The concern that sharks landed on mainland Ecuador were caught within the borders of the protected GMR prompted governmental concern. In response to these concerns, a law was passed in 1993 that required all ‘incidental’ sharks to be landed with fins intact. The result is that while Ecuadorian fishermen are not allowed to target sharks specifically, it is still legal (and common) to sell and export the fins from ‘‘incidental catch’’. This regulation enables mass quantities of shark fins to be exported from the Ecuadorian mainland to the Asian markets. National protected area status for the GMR was granted in 1998, commercial fishing (including shark finning) was prohibited and the Gala ́ pagos National Park was able to enforce Reserve regulations. But it was not until 2003 that the Ecuadorian Ministry of the Environment prohibited shark fishing, landing and trading (includ- ing the ‘‘incidental catch’’ of sharks) inside the GMR. Despite the active legislation to preserve shark populations within the protected 40-mile radius around the Gala ́ pagos Islands, illegal shark fishing and finning continues throughout the archipelago (Table 1)[11]. Illegal shark fishing within the GMR occurs via national and foreign industrial fishing vessels. From 2001–2007 the Ecuadorian authorities have seized 29 illegal shark catches within the boundaries of the GMR (Table 1)[11]. Seizures ranged from raids on illegal campsites to the capture of fishing vessels, with catch size ranging from two dead sharks to41800 shark fins. While Ecuadorian authorities and various non-governmental organiza- tions have caught, seized and impounded several illegal shark catches in recent years (Table 1)[11], illegal activities continue as evidenced by the apprehension of three shark-fishing vessels within the GMR boundaries during the latter half of 2011. On July 19, 2011 the Gala ́ pagos National Park, along with the Ecuadorian Navy, seized theFer Mary I(a long line fishing vessel from Manta, Ecuador) and crew of 30 on the southeast side of Genovesa. The boat was equipped with 1 long line fishing set with 369 hooks, and 6 ‘‘lanchas’’, or 8 m outboard powered fiber-glass boats, for patrolling long lines. 379 shark carcasses were onboard the boat. TheFer Mary Iwas boarded on July 23rd, and each shark was identified to species, the condition of each body was determined, and body size and sex were recorded for each of the sharks prior to the mandatory disposal of the bodies, as required by Ecuadorian law (to ensure that no profit is earned whatsoever from illegally fished animals). 2. Methods Shark length was measured as precaudal length (PCL) in mm, and converted to cm, for all sharks with heads attached. Deter- mination of total length (TL) ofAlopias superciliosuswas impossible because the top lobe of the caudal fin from these sharks had been removed. PCL was used to estimate TL based on allometric equations[16]. However, raw PCL was unobtainable on 64% of all big-eye threshers,A. superciliosus, as heads had been removed. Therefore, on these sharks (n¼194), the dorsal standard length DSL, a distance from the beginning of the dorsal fin to the precaudal pit was measured. To determine PCL for these speci- mens a relationship between PCL and DSL was calculated from a subsample of headedA. superciliosus(n¼76), and a linear model was developed to describe the length allometry ofA. superciliosus. PCL was quantified using the equation: PCL¼(0.88) DSLþ0.73 and determined TL from PCL using the approach previously described. TheR 2 for the",

When asymmetric competition involves 2 or more component species, the ranking of species’ competitive abilities may form competitive hierarchies (all species of higher rank out-compete all species of lower rank) or competitive networks (at least 1 species of lower rank out-competes ≥1 species of higher rank). Expectations of resource monopolization and patterns of distribution and abundance among species in competitive networks are expected to differ from those in competitive hierarchies. We conducted a field experiment to evaluate the relative competitive abilities of juveniles of 3 closely related species of reef fish (bird wrasse Gomphosus varius, fivestripe wrasse Thalassoma quinquevittatum and the sixbar wrasse T. hardwicke) on Moorea, French Polynesia. We controlled for intrinsic variation in survivorship among species and found that competition among these 3 species was highly asymmetric, resulting in a simple competitive hierarchy (sequence of competitive ability from superior to inferior competitors): fivestripe wrasse > bird wrasse > sixbar wrasse. We surveyed densities of the 3 reef fish species on 55 patch reefs and observed significant negative spatial covariation between superior and inferior competitors, consistent with competitive hierarchies that limit the spatial distributions of the inferior species (sixbar wrasse). Our work demonstrates that intense asymmetric competition and the formation of competitive hierarchies may be an important determinant of resource monopolization and patterns of distribution and abundance in reef fishes.

Most empirical studies of predation use simple experimental approaches to quantify the effects of predators on prey (e.g., using constant densities of predators, such as ambient vs. zero). However, predator densities vary in time, and these effects may not be well represented by studies that use constant predator densities. Although studies have independently examined the importance of predator density, temporal variability, and timing of arrival (i.e., early or late relative to prey), the relative contribution of these different predator regimes on prey abundance, diversity, and composition remains poorly understood. The hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus), a carnivorous coral reef fish, exhibits substantial variability in patch occupancy, density, and timing of arrival to natural reefs. Our field experiments demonstrated that effects of hawkfish on prey abundance depended on both hawkfish density and the timing of their arrival, but not on variability in hawkfish density. Relative to treatments without hawkfish, hawkfish presence reduced prey abundance by 50%. This effect increased with a doubling of hawkfish density (an additional 33%reduction), and when hawkfish arrived later during community development (a 34%reduction). Hawkfish did not affect within-patch diversity (species richness), but they increased between-patch diversity (beta) based on species incidence (22%), and caused shifts in species composition. Our results suggest that the timing of predator arrival can be as important as predator density in modifying prey abundance and community composition.

INTRODUCTION Predator migration, mortality, and recruitment can lead to temporal variability in predator density, creating a habitat landscape consisting of a mosaic of patches with differing patterns of predator occupancy, mean density, and timing of arrival (relative to prey). Such an assortment of predator patch occupancies may substan- tially alter the strength of predation, creating distinct patterns of prey abundance, diversity, and composition. Of the numerous studies identifying predation as a key process in prey coexistence, relative abundance, and composition (e.g., Sih et al. 1985, Spiller and Schoener 1998), the majority focus on effects of chronic predator exposure at a constant level (i.e., presence–absence or a gradient of predator densities). Variability in ecological processes has historically been considered noise; however, more recently, empir- ical studies of predation (Butler 1989, Navarrete 1996), stress (Benedetti-Cecchi et al. 2006), disturbance (Bish- op and Kelaher 2007), phenotypic plasticity (Miner and Vonesh 2004), and plant–herbivore interactions (Atalah et al. 2007) have documented the emergent effects of spatial and temporal variability. These effects of variance are usually explained by Jensen’s inequality: if f(x) is nonlinear, then the mean of the function is not equal to the function evaluated at the mean ( fðxÞ6¼f( ̄ x). Thus, studies that use a mean predator density (i.e., which focus onf( ̄ x)) will not describe the effect of predators when there is substantial variation aroundf( ̄ x) (see Ruel and Ayres 1999, Inouye 2005). Ecologically, there are many reasons to expect effects of predator density on prey to be nonlinear (Skalski and Gilliam 2001). Temporal variability in predator densities can reduce the strength of the effect of predators by shifting the availability of spatial or temporal refuges for prey. For example, Butler (1989) showed that temporally variable sunfish predation can produce unique macro- invertebrate communities in freshwater lakes relative to communities exposed to chronic sunfish predation. In intertidal invertebrate communities, Navarrete (1996) found that variable densities of whelks (the predator) Manuscript received 4 November 2011; revised 12 October 2012; accepted 22 October 2012; final version received 14 November 2012.

E-mail: adrian.stier@gmail.com 1057 allowed some prey to survive and grow while the whelk was absent and achieve a size refuge when the whelk was later present. This escape from predation modified competitive dynamics and altered the prey community. In addition to the effects of predator variance in affecting community organization, timing of predator arrival, especially relative to the timing of prey, can also modify the role of predation in community assembly by modifying priority effects (Morin 1984, Louette and De Meester 2007, Hoverman and Relyea 2008), succession (Olito and Fukami 2009), and alternative stable states (Price and Morin 2004). Predators may starve if they arrive in communities before prey, thereby alleviating predation pressure when prey do arrive. Alternatively, when predator and prey arrival times overlap, early predators may have the strongest effects, because prey will have insufficient time to reach size refugia, develop morphological or chemical defenses, or gain knowledge of predator-free space. Similarly, in size-structured systems, predators and prey may compete early in ontogeny, so early-arriving predators may avoid a competitive bottleneck (Olson et al. 1995). Reef fish communities are ideal for examining comparative effects of predator density, temporal variability in predation pressure, and timing of predator arrival relative to prey. Piscivores on reefs affect the abundance and diversity of prey (Hixon 1991, Hixon and Beets 1993, Almany and Webster 2006), and exhibit extensive spatio-temporal variability in abundance (Doherty 1991, Connell and Kingsford 1998, Dahlgren and Eggleston 2000). Here, we documented spatial and temporal variation in a predatory reef fish, the hawkfish Paracirrhites arcatus(hereafter hawkfish), on natural reefs. Then, we used a field experiment to evaluate the independent and combined effects of predator density, variation in predator density, and timing of predator arrival on abundance and diversity of fish communities. M ETHODS Study system, site, and species The island of Moorea (French Polynesia: 17830 0 S, 149850 0 W) is surrounded by a barrier reef with a shallow lagoon that ranges from 0.8–1.3 km wide, and is ;3–7 m deep (Galzin and Pointer 1985). The lagoon is interspersed with patch reefs within a matrix of sand, fine coral rubble, and coral pavement (Galzin and Pointer 1985), with individual patch reefs separated by less than a meter, to tens of meters. Hawkfish are a common, diurnal, sit-and-wait carnivore found perched upon the branches ofAcroporaspp. andPocilloporaspp. coral within the lagoon. Their diet includes recently settled fishes, shrimps, and other crustaceans (M. Leray, personal communication). Quantifying temporal patch occupancy of hawkfish To quantify natural variability in hawkfish density, we visually censused the abundance of hawkfish on 192 small patch reefs (area¼4.0261.67 m 2 , mean6SD) approximately twice per week from February to June 2005 (126 samples). We found hawkfish on 66 of the 192 surveyed patch reefs; we focus our analysis on 55 of the 66 reefs where hawkfish were observed at least twice. To summarize overall occupancy we calculated the average number of hawkfish per reef. Per reef, hawkfish were observed an average of 13.367.7 days of the 126 census days; density ranged from 1 to 5 hawkfish per patch reef (when hawkfish were present: 1.2260.27 hawkfish, mean61 SD; Fig. 1b). The 55 reefs were occupied 47% 627%of the 126 census days with a coefficient of variation of 1.48%60.94%(mean61 SD). To compute patterns of occupancy, we interpolated between obser- vations, assuming that hawkfish were continuously present between observations where they were present, continuously absent between observations where they FIG. 1. Summary of surveys of 192 patch reefs on the northern shore of Moorea, Society Islands, from February to June 2005 (approximately two times per week). (a) Frequency distribution of mean (right-censored) duration of hawkfish occupancy events on surveyed reefs. Occupancy events were defined as consecutive survey observations of hawkfish presence on a reef (maximum time between survey observations¼4 days). The duration of each occupancy event is the number of consecutive days of hawkfish presence, assuming that hawkfish were present on days between consecutive sightings. Note that our surveys did not allow us to discern among individual hawkfish; therefore, in some instances individual fish may have been lost and replaced by a new, similar-sized immigrant between census points. The mean duration of occupancy is the average duration of all occupancy events recorded for a given reef. (b) Time-averaged density of hawkfish from surveys of 192 patch reefs in Moorea. ADRIAN C.

In rare cases, extraordinarily high levels of settlement (episodic settlement events) have been docu- mented for a number of different families (Kami and Ikehara 1976, Pillai et al. 1983, Cowen 1985, Robertson 1988, Letourneur et al. 1998). High levels of postsettlement mortality often accompany episodic settle- ment events (e.g., Letourneur et al. 1998, Doherty et al. 2004, Jordan-Garza et al. 2009), which, in reef fishes, is typically attrib- uted to predation (Almany and Webster 2006). For example, in a settlement event of >40,000 unicornfish, Naso unicornis (Acanthu- ridae), Doherty et al. (2004) estimated that approximately 60% of settlers were killed overnight by predators (with dead or injured settlers rarely observed). However, other pro- cesses such as the depletion of food resources (Kami and Ikehara 1976) and disease (Lands- berg et al. 1995, Ferguson et al. 2000, Panek 2005) also likely contribute to mortality dur- ing episodic settlement. The most compelling evidence for alternate mechanisms of post- settlement mortality following episodic set- tlement is the documented presence of large numbers of newly settled fishes washing up on shores with no obvious evidence of physical damage from predatory encounters: Letour- neur et al. (1998) documented thousands of undamaged honeycomb groupers, Epinephelus merra (Serranidae), being washed ashore on Réunion Island following a large recruitment event, and a recent study by Jordán-Garza et al. (2009) described up to 40 dead sharpnose pufferfish, Canthigaster rostrata (Tetraodon- tidae), per square meter on the beaches of the Yucatán. One possible explanation for this peculiar phenomenon is epizootic disease, whereby pathogens have high transmission rates in animal populations at high densi- ties.

White 2,6 Abstract: Marine organisms occasionally settle at exceptional densities, whereby thousands of individuals arrive concurrently. High levels of mortality, which has historically been attributed to predation or competition, often follow this epi- sodic settlement of reef fishes. Here, however, we observed large numbers of newly settled surgeonfish (Ctenochaetus striatus) with white lesions lying dead on the sand amongst patch reefs following separate episodic settlement events in 2006 and 2009 in Moorea, French Polynesia. Pathogens have been identified as an important driver of population dynamics in other marine organisms but less so for reef fishes.

(2009) gave no ob- vious indication that C. rostrata were diseased. Thus, despite an emerging appreciation of the consequences of disease transmission in population die-offs of marine invertebrates (e.g., sea urchins, abalone, coral, and sea fans [Harvell et al. 1999]), there is little evidence to suggest that epizootic disease plays an im- portant role in mortality of reef fishes. In February 2006 and 2009, we observed two separate episodic settlement events of the striped bristletooth, Ctenochaetus striatus (Acanthuridae), where settlers formed large schools that swarmed throughout the lagoon of Moorea, French Polynesia. High levels of settler mortality followed this episodic set- tlement within the first week; however, here we hypothesize that an unknown pathogen caused high mortality, which left large num- bers of dead and dying fish within the lagoon. We used a biannual 5-yr data set (2004 to 2009) to document two exceptionally high re- cruitment events of C. striatus and concurrent observations of pathogen-associated mass mortality of C. striatus to motivate future re- search. materials and methods Moorea is a small volcanic island (∼61 km of coastline) with a barrier reef enclosing a la- goon around most of the island’s perimeter (see Galzin and Pointer [1985] for a descrip- tion). To describe temporal variation in Ctenochaetus striatus recruitment we explored a 5-yr data set of fish community counts con- ducted biannually at 13 locations surrounding Moorea. Sites (26 total) were paired within two main reef habitats: (1) at nearshore fring- ing reef, and (2) at the backreef near the reef crest. Twice per year (in January – February and July – August), observers conducted three 20 m × 2 m transects to visually estimate the abundance and size of all fishes at each of the sites (see Lison de Loma et al. [2008] for full survey methodology and site map). Acanthu- rids like C. striatus can have specialized larvae that may spend several months in the plank- ton (Doherty et al. 1995) and settle at large sizes (Doherty et al. 2004, Lecchini and Galzin 2005; this study). We used 10 cm as the maximum size of C. striatus recruits, based upon direct in situ observations of C. striatus recruits and observed size frequency distri- butions of C. striatus during each sampling period. results Recruit densities of Ctenochaetus striatus were more than six times higher in February 2006 and 2009, in both the fringing reef and back- reef, relative to the average density of recruits in other sampling periods (∼3 recruits/50 m 2 ), respectively. There were smaller increases in 2009, relative to 2006 (Figure 1), but in both 2006 and 2009 we observed hundreds of ap- parently diseased fish lying dead or dying on the lagoon floor. Visible symptoms of the ap- parent infection and poor condition included large white lesions on the body and particu- larly anterior to the caudal peduncle, de- creased swimming ability, and tattered fins (Figure 2). It is interesting that we did not ob- serve predators immediately consuming dead or dying individuals. Predators may have been satiated, or alternatively may have avoided prey due to their poor condition. discussion Episodic settlement events have been docu- mented for a number of families of coral reef fishes; however, our observations suggest- ing disease as a potential mechanism of post- settlement mortality are particularly unusual. Epizootic disease in marine fish appears to be ephemeral, and reports of obvious disease- associated lesions are relatively uncommon in reef fish populations (although disease inci- dence has been linked to density in a variety of taxa: Goulson and Cory 1995, Wilcox and Elderd 2003, Bell et al. 2006). A review of epi- zootic disease in coral reef fishes by Panek (2005) identified host-ectoparasite relation- ships and bacterial, fungal, and viral patho- gens as possible causative agents of disease outbreak. Biotoxic algae (e.g., Caulerpa) and toxic dinoflagellates (e.g., Gambierdiscus and Prorocentrum) have also been cited as the pos- sible etiologic agents of disease in reef fish Figure 1.

As a result, past studies overestimated the occurrence of risk enhancement for additive designs, and tended to overestimate the occurrence of risk reduction for substitutive designs.

Ecology Letters(2012) INTRODUCTION Traditionally, ecological systems have been studied as subsets of pairwise interactions, with the hope that these can then be assem- bled to predict the spatial and temporal patterns of intact communi- ties (e.g. Oksanenet al.1981; Wootton 1994). If pairwise interactions are independent of other members of the community, then community dynamics can be assembled piecemeal. However, if interaction strengths are not independent of other players in the system, then observed community dynamics will depart from simple predictions based on pairwise interactions (Wootton 1994; Bolker et al.2003; Werner & Peacor 2003). Such departures can reveal the action of complex and potentially novel forms of species interac- tions, which have been referred to as higher order interactions, trait mediated indirect interactions or non-consumptive predator effects (Wootton 1994; Bolkeret al.2003; Werner & Peacor 2003). As predator–prey interactions comprise the foundation of food web dynamics, many studies have focused on examining possible interac- tions among multiple predator species and a shared prey (Polis & Holt 1992; Sihet al.1998; Iveset al.2005; Vance-Chalcraft & Soluk 2005; Griffen 2006; Schmitz 2009). In general, these studies show that the effects of multiple predators are often not independent, suggesting that a better understanding of these higher order interac- tions is needed to fully appreciate food web dynamics. Interactions between predators (e.g. cooperation, competition or intraguild predation), as well as anti-predator responses by prey, can lead to emergent ‘multiple predator effects’ (MPEs), where prey con- sumption rates by multiple predators foraging in concert cannot be predicted by knowing the independent effects of each predator on prey survival (e.g. Polis & Holt 1992; Sihet al.1998; Iveset al.2005; Vance-Chalcraft & Soluk 2005; Griffen 2006; Schmitz 2009). Multiple predator species can combine: (1) independently, (2) synergistically (leading to prey risk enhancement: Soluk & Collins 1988; Losey & Denno 1998; Sihet al.1998) or (3) antagonistically (e.g. leading to prey risk reduction: Sihet al.1998; Vance-Chalcraft & Soluk 2005). Studies of MPEs typically compare observed patterns of prey survival in the presence of combinations of predators to expected survival pre- dicted from the independent effects of each predator species in monoculture (Soluk & Collins 1988; Billick & Case 1994; Sihet al. 1998; Griffen 2006). Early studies of MPEs misinterpreted results by using incorrect models to calculate expected effects (see critiques by Billick & Case 1994; Wootton 1994), or by ignoring prey losses in the absence of predators (see clarifications by Sihet al.1998; Vonesh & Osenberg 2003). Indeed, considerable debate in the literature focused on understanding how statistical models used to make predictions about the expected effects of multiple predators are linked to the underlying biological models assumed to drive prey survival (Soluk & Collins 1988; Billick & Case 1994; Sihet al.1998; Vonesh & Osenberg 2003; Griffen 2006). A consensus approach emerged (Vonesh & Osenberg 2003; Vance-Chalcraft & Soluk 2005; Griffen 2006). Specif- ically, if two predators have independent effects, then expected pro- portion of prey surviving (hereafter prey survival) in the presence of both predators, ^ S 1;2 can be calculated based on prey survival in the presence of each predator species in monoculture,S 1 andS 2 , corrected for background mortality (i.e. survival in no predator control treat- mentS ctl ) (also see Table 1): ^ S 1;2 ¼ S 1 \"S 2 S ctl ð1Þ Equation 1 is a corrected version of the ‘Multiplicative Risk Model’ of Soluk & Collins (1988) based on an additive design (i.e. where the combined effects of predator species 1 and 2, at densitiesC 1 andC 2 , are predicted based on their isolated effects, also evaluated atC 1 andC 2 ) (Vonesh & Osenberg 2003). An analogous null model for a substitutive design (where total predator density is the same in both the monoculture and mixed species treatments) yields: ^ S 1;2 2 ¼ S 0:5 1 S 0:5 2 S ctl ð2Þ Despite general consensus among ecologists on these calculations of expected survival in combined predator treatments, the derivation (Table 1) and underlying assumptions of eqns 1 and 2 ©2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS Ecology Letters, (2012)doi: 10.1111/ele.12005 (hereafter referred to as the Multiplicative Risk Model) are still not well appreciated. Most notably, the Multiplicative Risk Model is often assumed to account for prey depletion (Sihet al.1998; Grif- fen 2006), ostensibly because it adjusts survival probabilities so that they are conditional (i.e. prey cannot be eaten twice). However, the Multiplicative Risk Model assumes that prey per capita mortality rates imposed by predators are constant over the course of the experiment, which is only valid when predators have linear (i.e. Type I) functional responses, when prey are continuously replen- ished, or experimental durations are sufficiently short that depletion is inconsequential (Collinset al.1981; Juliano & Williams 1985; Juli- anoet al.2001). These assumptions are violated in most empirical studies, because most predators have nonlinear functional responses (Hassellet al.1976, 1977; Jeschekeet al.2004) and because most predation studies run sufficiently long that prey density declines appreciably from the start to end of trials. For example, we exam- ined 100 multiple predator studies reviewed by Vance-Chalcraft et al.(2007) and found that on average prey were depleted by 70% over the course of these experiments. Therefore, the assumption of constant instantaneous per capita feeding rates (i.e. temporally invariant mortality rates of prey) is probably severely violated in studies of MPEs, and this could affect how we interpret and gener- alise the results of multiple predator studies. To our knowledge, no studies have examined explicitly how prey depletion in combination with a nonlinear functional response influ- ences the expected results of multiple predator studies. In this study, we show that depletion of prey by predators in combination with a nonlinear functional response leads to conclusions of risk enhance- ment or risk reduction even when predators have independent effects. Moreover, we show that the direction and magnitude of bias is in part a consequence of the experimental design. As a result, past studies (including meta-analyses and syntheses of the literature: e.g. Sihet al. 1998; Schmitz 2007) likely misestimated the importance of MPEs. Specifically, studies that used additive experimental designs with prey depletion were more likely to conclude risk enhancement, and studies that used substitutive designs were usually more likely to conclude risk reduction, even when predators affected prey independently (Fig. 1). We also suggest some approaches for dealing with depletion in studies of MPEs that will reduce biases in detection, estimation and interpre- tation of emergent MPEs. METHODS Although a variety of nonlinear functional responses are possible, here, we assumed that predators exhibited a Type II functional response: F¼ aNC 1þahN ð3Þ whereFis the instantaneous feeding rate of one predator,Cis predator density,Nis prey density,ais attack rate andhis handling time (Holling 1959). Type II functional responses are thought to characterise the feeding rate of many types of predators (Jescheke et al.2004). We also assumed that mortality of prey in the absence of predators was negligible: that is, survival in the control treatment was 100% (S ctl =1). As a result, prey survival,S, in the presence of a predator assemblage withnpredator species (with predator species iat densityC i ), can be found by integrating the aggregate feeding rates over the duration of the study (from time 0 toT), as prey density (N t ) declines: S¼1& R T 0 P n i¼1 a i N t C i 1þa i h i N t dt N 0 ð4Þ We simulated foraging trials by solving eqn 4 numerically. First, we did this for two predator species in monoculture, which yielded S 1 andS 2 . Second, we generated the survival of prey in the presence of both predator species under the assumption of independence (i.e. the true value ofS 1,2 ) using eqn 4 and the same parameters used to generate the monoculture results. Third, we applied eqns 1 or 2 (depending on the experimental design being examined) to generate ^ S 1;2 (i.e. the standard nu",

KeywordsAlpheus!Coral reefs!Exosymbiont! Multiple predator effects!Trapezia Introduction It is well known from comparative studies that the efficacy of different species of mutualists can vary significantly within a guild (Little et al.2004; Mieog et al.2009). However, these studies rarely examine interactions between mutualists within a guild or quantify the conse- quences of these interactions on the host (but see Palmer et al.2003). Mutualist–mutualist interactions are of par- ticular interest in diverse systems such as coral reefs, where a number of species can co-occur on single hosts, creating a complex network of possible higher-order interactions (e.g., cooperative, competitive, or intraguild predatory interactions) that may non-independently modify the ben- efit a host receives by supporting multiple mutualists. Our study tested for an emergent Multiple Defender Effect from two species of crustacean exosymbionts that co-habit a common scleractinian coral and collectively defend the coral from predators. Individual species within a guild of mutualists may exhibit differences in the efficacy of the services provided to their host species. This pattern has been observed both within defensive mutualisms, such as ant–plant systems (Palmer and Brody2007; Palmer et al.2008), pollination Communicated by Steven Kohler.

Intraguild competition or coop- eration among mutualists can lead to reduced or enhanced mutualist efficacy relative to that which is expected though a summing of the independent pairwise effects of single species of mutualists in isolation (Stachowicz and Whit- latch2005). However, few studies have attempted to go beyond estimating the differences in the effects of indi- vidual mutualists, which can be achieved through the fac- torial manipulation of multiple mutualists. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis by Morris et al. (2007) on independent and interactive effects of natural enemies and mutualists on plant performance found that of the 160 studies published on interactive effects (enemy–enemy, enemy–mutualist, and mutualist–mutualist), only ten (reviewed from five different papers) exist on mutualist–mutualist interactions, while 114 focus on enemy–mutualist dynamics, and 36 focus on enemy–enemy dynamics. There was, however, no consistent effect of intraguild mutualist interactions on partner performance; across the ten mutualist–mutualist studies, the authors found evidence for independent, antagonistic, and synergistic effects of groups of mutualists on hosts. The study of higher-order interactions that lead to a non- independent response is not new to the field of ecology (Billick and Case1994). Indeed, the study of intraguild dynamics among predators is now commonplace in a number of systems (Griffen2006; Vance-Chalcraft et al. 2007). An experimental design and analytical framework for testing higher-order interactions within guilds has been developed in these multiple-predator studies. Tests for multiple-predator effects are often conducted using a fac- torial manipulation of predators (crossing the presence or absence of predator A with the presence or absence of predator B; Exlo ̈ v2000; Warfe and Barmuta2004). The expected survival probability of prey in the presence of both predator A and B (P A?B ) follows the following multiplicative risk model: ^ P AþB ¼P NP ðP A =P NP ÞðP B =P NP Þð1Þ whereP(A is predator A, B is predator B, and NP is no predator) is the survival probability in the presence of different predator treatments (Sih et al.1998; Soluk and Collins1988; Vonesh and Osenberg2003). Expected survival probability in the presence of two predators assumes a multiplicative risk model because predation events by each predator species are dependent upon predation by the other species (i.e., conditional probability—a single prey item cannot be eaten twice). Because two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA; the appropriate analysis for a factorial design) assumes an additive model, the multiplicative risk model above can be log transformed to an additive form for analysis: logð ^ P AþB Þ¼logðP NP ÞþlogðP A =P NP ÞþlogðP B =P NP Þ ð2Þ In our study detailed below, we tested for intraguild higher-order interactions among mutualists, a term we define as emergent multiple defender effects (MDEs), the analog of emergent multiple predator effects (MPEs). We focused on combined effects of mutualistic symbi- oses in coral reefs. Symbioses on reefs are common and are exemplified by the well-known relationship between scle- ractinian corals and endosymbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) (Muscatine and Porter1977; Rowan1998), a mutualism thought to be the fundamental factor allowing coral reefs to persist in the oligotrophic tropics. Although guilds of dif- ferent endosymbionts are known to provide variable amounts of support to corals and to respond differently to heat stress (Baker et al.2004; Fabricius et al.2004; Rowan 2004), their interactive effects are poorly studied (Rowan 1998). By comparison, exosymbiotic crustaceans have received relatively little attention despite their potential importance for the growth, reproduction, and survival of coral (Glynn1983; Stachowicz and Hay1999; Stewart et al.2006) and the potential large-scale effects of these mutualisms on reef dynamics (Glynn1987). In the central Pacific, trapeziid crabs of the genusTra- peziaand the snapping shrimpAlpheus lottiniform heter- osexual pairs and will not tolerate the presence of other conspecifics (Castro1978; Huber1987). Other species of crustacean mutualists, however, may be tolerated and effectively increase the ‘defense force’ of the coral head. In initial studies which we carried out in the summer of 2006, we observed up to five species ofTrapezia(T. flavopunc- tata,T. serenei,T. bidentata,T. areolata, andT. bella), along withAlpheus lottini, occupying a singlePocillopora coral colony host at the study site. This ‘species stacking’ of mutualists may allow the colonization of symbionts of different defensive abilities and create intraguild dynamics that facilitatePocilloporasurvival (C.S. McKeon, unpub- lished data). Our study system using two common species of ‘guard’ crustaceans is a first step toward understanding this diversity and represents a state frequently found in low-diversity lagoonal environments. We conducted a series of experiments and behavioral observations on two crustacean species (Trapezia sereneiandAlpheus lottini ‘stripes’, hereafter referred to as Trapezia and Alpheus, respectively) to assess how the independent and combined effects of these exosymbionts contribute to defense of a host coral,Pocilloporacf.meandrina(hereafter Pocillo- pora) from the coral-eating seastarCulcita novaeguineae (hereafter Culcita). Our study was designed to answer the following questions: (1) Do exosymbionts effectively defend the coral? (2) Are the defensive responses of both exosymbionts equal? (3) Does a doubling in exosymbiont Oecologia 123 density through the addition of a second species increase the defensive efficacy? (4) Are the effects of multiple defensive exosymbiont species independent, antagonistic (less than predicted under the assumption of indepen- dence), or synergistic (better than expected)? Methods Study species All species of the coral genusPocilloporaare facultative hosts of theTrapeziagenus of obligate crustaceans (tra- peziid crabs) and theAlpheus lottinicomplex (a species complex of alpheid snapping shrimps). Both Trapezia and Alpheus are most commonly found in heterosexual pairs (Castro1978; Preston1971) which aggressively defend their territory from conspecifics (Huber1987).

Appendage regeneration appears to be common when viewed across the metazoan phylogeny, yet this ability has been lost in many taxa to varying degrees. Within species, the capacity for regeneration also can vary ontogenetically among individuals. Here we argue that appendage regeneration along the secondary body axis may be constrained by fundamental traits such as body size, aging, life stage, and growth pattern. Studies of the molecular mechanisms affecting regeneration have been conducted primarily with small organisms at early life stages. Such investigations disregard the dramatic shifts in morphology and physiology that organisms undergo as they age, grow, and mature. To help explain interspecific and intraspecific constraints on regeneration, we link particular fundamental traits to specific molecular mechanisms that control regeneration. We present a new synthesis for how these fundamental traits may affect the molecular mechanisms of regeneration at the tissue, cellular, and genomic levels of biological organization. Future studies that explore regeneration in organisms across a broad phylogenetic scale, and within an ontogenetic framework, will help elucidate the proximate mechanisms that modulate regeneration and may reveal new biomedical applications for use in regenerative medicine.",

Thus, increased sediment removal from a coral host can only be achieved by increasing the number of species of symbionts on that coral, even though these species are functionally equivalent. Symbiont diversity plays a key role, not through added functionality but by overcoming density limitation likely imposed by intraspecific mating systems.

Alone, corals removed 10% of sediment, but removal increased to 30% and 48% with the presence of two and four symbionts, respectively.

Introduction Mutualisms are widespread across taxa, contributing to the structure and function of ecosystems [1,2,3], especially when the mutualisms involve foundation species such as trees or stony corals. Historically, mutualisms have been studied through pairwise interactions, for example, between a single symbiont and a single host. However, many hosts are inhabited by multiple species of potentially interacting symbionts [4,5] necessitating the need to understand how multiple co-occurring symbiont species influence patterns of association within the symbiont guild, and how effects of symbiont species combine to influence the host [6,7,8,9]. Co-occupation of hosts by multiple symbionts creates opportu- nities for emergent effects on the host that potentially go beyond effects anticipated based upon pairwise interactions (i.e. higher- order interactions, [10]). For example, experimental studies of predator-prey interactions have evaluated how the combined effects of two or more predator species compare to those predicted based upon pairwise effects of a single predator species [11]. These ‘‘multiple predator effect’’ studies evaluate if effects are indepen- dent (e.g., the predator species do not interact), synergistic (i.e., risk to prey is greater than expected), or inhibitory (e.g., predators incur intraguild predation or interference and thus risk to prey is reduced) [12]. A comparable framework may prove valuable for understanding symbiont effects [9,13], and thus may help explain patterns of symbiont association and host responses to shifts in symbiont density and diversity. For example, antagonism between pollinator species can reduce the pollination services provided to plants by subordinate pollinators [7]. Insights from such experiments can evaluate putative links between biodiversity of the symbionts and ecosystem function mediated through host responses, as has been suggested in studies of myrmecophytic ants that defend plants [14,15], snail grazers that remove epiphytes on algae [16], bacterial endosymbionts that convey antibiotic resistance to corals [17], and microbes that supply nitrogen to plant roots [18,19]. Tropical coral reef ecosystems, with their exceptional biodiver- sity, are ideal models for studying mutualisms. Many reef corals house symbionts within tissues (i.e., endosymbionts, such as zooxanthellae) and within their branches (i.e., exosymbionts, such as some fishes and invertebrates). These symbionts depend critically upon the coral for their existence. For example, in the Indo-Pacific, some species of trapeziid crabs and alpheid shrimps live exclusively within the branches of pocilloporid corals [20]. Furthermore, work has shown that these decapod symbionts increase their coral host’s survival and growth by defending them from corallivorous sea stars and gastropods [13,21,22], removing PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org1April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e32079 mucus nets produced by vermetid gastropods [23], and removing sediment deposited on the coral tissue [24]. Only one study has examined how.1 species of exosymbiont combine to influence coral hosts: McKeon et al. [13] suggested that effects of two coral symbionts (Trapezia sereneiandAlpheus lottini) combined synergisti- cally to protect the host coral from seastar predators. Sediment removal by coral symbionts may be particularly critical to the resilience of reef ecosystems. Natural disturbances (e.g. cyclones and storms) and coastal urbanization cause terrestrial runoff and re-suspension of bottom sediments, which increase sediment deposition onto corals [25]. Sedimentation decreases growth and increases mortality of corals [26,27]. Although corals can remove some sediments from their surface through mucus sloughing, cilia movement, or polyp extension [28,29,30], symbionts potentially play a critical role in protecting corals from the deleterious effects of sedimentation by removing additional sediment [24]. Here, we document patterns of association between symbiont species occurring inPocilloporacoral colonies. We then use an experimental design and analytical approach borrowed from the predator-prey literature [31] to quantify the separate and combined effects of the two most common and positively associated symbiont species on sediment removal from corals. Materials and Methods Field Survey Our study was conducted on Moorea, French Polynesia, a high island surrounded by a barrier reef. Over three consecutive days (July 19–21, 2010), we conducted a field survey on the western shore of Moorea near the reef crest (17u3292099S, 149u5493499W and 17u3490599S, 149u5295099W). We collected colonies of Pocillopora cf. verrucosa(hereafterPocillopora) ranging from 45– 160 cm maximum diameter from 1–2 m depth by enveloping each colony in a plastic bag to prevent symbiont loss, and removing each colony from the substrate with a chisel. Corals were immediately transported in coolers to the laboratory, where we measured each coral (maximum diameter, perpendicular diame- ter, maximum height and circumference) and removed all coral- dwelling fishes and decapods. We identified all decapods larger than,4 mm in carapace length and retained corals and decapods for later use in the experiments (see below). We focused on trapeziid crabs and alpheid snapping shrimps because they were common, conspicuous, readily identifiable, and are known to play an important functional role in the growth and survival of Pocillopora[21]. Sediment Removal Experiment We conducted an experiment in four large flow-through outdoor seawater tanks (2670 l; 3 m diameter), with the experiment repeated across four consecutive nights (each tank and night comprised a block). For each block, we selected five corals for similarity in size, branching morphology, and color. All corals came from the field survey, had originally contained symbionts, and had been collected within 48 h prior to their use in the experiment. We used two species of symbionts:Alpheus cf. lottini ‘stripes’(hereafterAlpheus lottini: see Table S1)andTrapezia serenei. Each tank contained a single replicate of each of five treatments, which were assigned at random within each block: Control (0 symbionts); AA (2Alpheus lottini); TT (2Trapezia serenei); AT (1A. lottiniand 1T. serenei); AATT (2A. lottiniand 2T. serenei). Thus, the experiment combined an additive and substitutive design [31]: the additive design controlled intraspecific density, and the substitutive design controlled total symbiont density. Intraspecific pairs of decapods collected from the field survey were maintained in flow-through containers for up to 48 h prior to the start of the experiment. For the AA, TT, and AATT treatments, intraspecfic pairs were collected from the same coral. We retained intraspecific pairs for t",

The global decline in estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) is affecting a number of critical benefits, or ecosystem services. We review the main ecological services across a variety of ECEs, including marshes, mangroves, nearshore coral reefs, seagrass beds, and sand beaches and dunes. Where possible, we indicate estimates of the key economic values arising from these services, and discuss how the natural variability of ECEs impacts their benefits, the synergistic relationships of ECEs across seascapes, and management implications. Although reliable valuation estimates are beginning to emerge for the key services of some ECEs, such as coral reefs, salt marshes, and mangroves, many of the important benefits of seagrass beds and sand dunes and beaches have not been assessed properly. Even for coral reefs, marshes, and mangroves, important ecological services have yet to be valued reliably, such as cross-ecosystem nutrient transfer (coral reefs), erosion control (marshes), and pollution control (mangroves). An important issue for valuing certain ECE services, such as coastal protection and habitat–fishery linkages, is that the ecological functions underlying these services vary spatially and temporally. Allowing for the connectivity between ECE habitats also may have important implications for assessing the ecological functions underlying key ecosystems services, such coastal protection, control of erosion, and habitat–fishery linkages. Finally, we conclude by suggesting an action plan for protecting and/or enhancing the immediate and longer-term values of ECE services. Because the connectivity of ECEs across land–sea gradients also influences the provision of certain ecosystem services, management of the entire seascape will be necessary to preserve such synergistic effects. Other key elements of an action plan include further ecological and economic collaborative research on valuing ECE services, improving institutional and legal frameworks for management, controlling and regulating destructive economic activities, and developing ecological restoration options.

INTRODUCTION Estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) are some of the most heavily used and threatened natural systems globally (Lotze et al. 2006, Worm et al. 2006, Halpern et al. 2008). Their deterioration due to human activities is intense and increasing;50%of salt marshes, 35%of mangroves, 30%of coral reefs, and 29%of seagrasses are either lost or degraded worldwide (Valiela et al. 2001, MEA 2005, Orth et al. 2006, UNEP 2006, FAO 2007, Waycott et al. 2009). This global decrease in ECEs is known to affect at least three critical ecosystem services (Worm et al. 2006): the number of viable (non- collapsed) fisheries (33%decline); the provision of nursery habitats such as oyster reefs, seagrass beds, and wetlands (69%decline); and filtering and detoxifi- cation services provided by suspension feeders, sub- merged vegetation, and wetlands (63%decline). The loss of biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and coastal vege- tation in ECEs may have contributed to biological invasions, declining water quality, and decreased coastal protection from flooding and storm events (Braatz et al. 2007, Cochard et al. 2008, Koch et al. 2009).

Ellison. 5 E-mail: ebarbier@uwyo.edu 169 Such widespread and rapid transformation of ECEs and their services suggest that it is important to understand what is at stake in terms of critical benefits and values. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the main ecological services across a variety of ECEs, including marshes, mangroves, nearshore coral reefs, seagrass beds, and sand beaches and dunes. Where available, we cite estimates of the key economic values arising from the services provided by these ECEs. In addition, we discuss how the natural variability in these systems in space and time results in nonlinear functions and services that greatly influence their economic value (Barbier et al. 2008, Koch et al. 2009) and some of the synergistic properties of ECEs. Because they exist at the interface between the coast, land, and watersheds, ECEs can produce cumulative benefits that are much more significant and unique than the services provided by any single ecosystem. Finally, we finish by highlighting the main management implications of this review of ECE services and their benefits, and provide an ‘‘action plan’’ to protect and/or enhance their immediate and longer term value to humankind. M ETHODS:ASSESSINGECE SERVICES ANDVALUES In identifying the ecosystem services provided by natural environments, a common practice is to adopt the broad definition of the Millennium Ecosystem Assess- ment (MEA 2005) that ‘‘ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems.’’ Thus, the term ‘‘ecosystem services’’ is usually interpreted to imply the contribution of nature to a variety of ‘‘goods and services,’’ which in economics would normally be classified under three different categories (Barbier 2007): (1) ‘‘goods’’ (e.g., products obtained from ecosystems, such as resource harvests, water, and genetic material), (2) ‘‘services’’ (e.g., recreational and tourism benefits or certain ecological regulatory and habitat functions, such as water purification, climate regulation, erosion control, and habitat provision), and (3) cultural benefits (e.g., spiritual and religious beliefs, heritage values). However, for economists, the term ‘‘benefit’’ has a specific meaning. Mendelsohn and Olmstead (2009:326) summarize the standard definition as follows: ‘‘The economic benefit provided by an environmental good or service is the sum of what all members of society would be willing to pay for it.’’ Thus, given this specific meaning, some economists argue that it is misleading to characterize all ecosystem services as ‘‘benefits.’’ As explained by Boyd and Banzhaf (2007:619), ‘‘as end- products of nature, final ecosystem services are not benefits nor are they necessarily the final product consumed. For example, recreation is often called an ecosystem service. It is more appropriately considered a benefit produced using both ecological services and conventional goods and services.’’ To illustrate this point, they consider recreational angling. It req",

KeywordsCorallivore Density dependence Porites  Predation Introduction Stony coral colonies often occur in high densities, which can affect their growth, competitive ability, and survival by modifying abiotic (Thomas and Atkinson1997; Sebens et al.2003; Reidenbach et al.2007) or biotic (Idjadi and Karlson2007) conditions. For example, Vermeij and Sandin (2008) showed a positive effect of conspecific density on the mortality of recently settledSiderastrea radians, and evidence suggests that heterospecific aggre- gation in adult fungiid corals can depress growth rates (Elahi2008). Similarly,studies of population regulation theory highlight the importance of prey density as a mod- ifier of predator–prey interactions via processes such as predator dilution/aggregation and predator swamping (Murdoch1994). Yet, despite the fact that corallivores are well known to affect the demography of corals (Meesters et al.1994; Aeby and Santavy2006; Cole et al.2008; Pratchett et al.2009), few studies have explored how the size of coral aggregates affects predation on stony corals. A rare exception was a recent study in which Jaye- wardene et al. (2009) quantified predation rates via grazing scars onPorites compressatransplants placed in differing densities of existing live coral. This study found lower bite frequencies at higher coral densities, which was evidence of predator dilution. However, some coral predators (e.g., butterfly fishes) are cryptic in their foraging (e.g., removal of single polyps), and therefore, their effects are less con- spicuous due to the absence of grazing scars (Rotjan and Lewis2008). An alternative approach to quantifying the effects of corallivores is to measure net growth. This incorporates the costs of tissue damage and skeletal removal. In our study, a factorial field experiment exam- ined the effects of coral density and corallivore exposure on the skeletal growth of massive reef-buildingPorites.

Moorea is a volcanic island with a narrow lagoon containing patch reefs, interspersed with sand, coral rubble, and pavement enclosed by a discontinuous barrier reef (Galzin and Pointier1985). Patch reefs are dominated by stony corals, the most common of which are massive members ofPorites spp. (a species complex composed mostly ofPorites lobataandP. lutea,hereafter referred to asPorites; Edmunds and Lenihan2010) and the branching/ sheeting coral,Porites rus.A diverse suite of corallivores existinMoorea,includingfishes(Table1)and invertebrates (Rotjan and Lewis2008). Surveys were conducted in the lagoon east of Cook’s pass at an average depth of 3 m. This study focused on the net growth of small colonies (2–3 cm diameter) ofPorites, an effective colonist and generally weak interference competitor for space in direct interactions with most other genera of corals (Idjadi and Karlson2007). Experimental design In January 2009, a field experiment was conducted to quantify the effects of predator exposure (cage and partial- cage) and coral density (low and high) on the growth of Porites. Because local structure can augment fish popula- tions (Jennings et al.1996; Syms and Jones2000), poten- tially impacting predation rates, the experiment was set up in an open sand-plain, parallel to the reef, at least 30 m from the nearest structure. Thirty-two (32) concrete blocks, each measuring 0.590.2590.25 m(length9width9height),were placed at 10-m increments along the plain to create experimental reefs. Sixteen reefs were fully caged to exclude corallivores (circumference=1.5 m, height= 1 m, mesh size=2.54 cm). The remaining 16 reefs served as cage controls, possessing a full top and up-current side, with all remaining sides extending only 5 cm above the concrete blocks in order to allow access by corallivores. To obtain a better understanding of the subset of co- rallivores present in the experimental region, divers con- ducted surveys at four different lagoon sites within 3 km of the experimental array in February 2010. At each site, divers swam five 25-m transects and noted the presence of any corallivores within 4 m of the transect (Table1), as well as bite scars on live coral. Corallivorous fish were considered as any species listed as a consumer of live coral (see Rotjan and Lewis2008). In studies of density dependence, the most relevant metric for determining densities is the local neighborhood of a focal individual, rather than the mean abundance in a quadrat (Lloyd1967). This metric, termed mean crowding (m*), is calculated as follows: m   ¼mþ m k ;ð1Þ wheremandkare the maximum likelihood estimates of a mean and shape parameter of a negative binomial distri- bution (Lloyd1967). Them*ofPoritesnubbins near the study site was estimated as 9.52±1.93 (mean±0.1 SE; range: 0–12), based on data from 30 randomly assigned 1-m 2 quadrates placed along six 30-m transect lines.

Coral collection, measurement, and predator surveys One hundred and sixty (160) nubbins (2–3 cm in diameter) ofPoriteswere collected from the pavement near the reef crest and affixed to small plastic bases usingZ-spar marine epoxy (Splash Zone Compound TM ). Colonies were weighed using the buoyant weight technique (Davies 1989), returned to the field, and affixed several centimeters apart from each other to experimental reefs via cable ties at one of the two density treatments. An analysis of variance confirmed that the average nubbin size was equal among treatment groups (F 2,28 =0.126,P=0.882). Approximately every 4 days, a single observer swam the length of the experimental array, pausing*5 m from each cage, to note any corallivorous species (Table1) and their abundance within the cages (Fig.1). The diver then approached each cage to check for cryptic fishes and checked for the evidence of skeletal removal on the experimental corals. Cages were scrubbed twice weekly to reduce fouling, and after 23 days, corals were collected and transported back to the laboratory, where a final buoyant weight was obtained. The foil technique (Marsh1970) was used to estimate the surface area of each colony to stan- dardize the growth rates (g per cm 2 per day). Data analysis One replicate of the high-density caged treatment was lost during the experiment, leaving an unbalanced nested design. Therefore, each concrete reef was considered a replicate, and the growth response variable was generated from the average growth of colonies within a concrete reef. Normality and variance homogeneity were assessed visu- ally through quantile–quantile plots, Shapiro–Wilk nor- mality test, and Levene’s test. Data did not deviate significantly from a normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk normality test,W=0.957,P=0.241), and variances were notsignificantlyheterogeneous(Levene’stest F 3,27 =0.348,P=0.791). A two-factor ANOVA was used to test for the effects of predator exposure, density, and their interaction on average growth of experimental colonies. Though occasion",

In particular, the paradigm for strong, directly density‐dependent (DDD) postsettlement mortality stands in contrast to recent evidence for inversely density‐dependent (IDD) mortality. We review the processes responsible for DDD and IDD per capita mortality in reef fishes, noting that the pattern observed depends on predator and prey behavior, the spatial configuration of the reef habitat, and the spatial and temporal scales of observation. Specifically, predators tend to produce DDD prey mortality at their characteristic spatial scale of foraging, but prey mortality is IDD at smaller spatial scales due to attack‐abatement effects (e.g., risk dilution). As a result, DDD mortality may be more common than IDD mortality on patch reefs, which tend to constrain predator foraging to the same scale as prey aggregation, eliminating attack‐abatement effects. Additionally, adjacent groups of prey on continuous reefs may share a subset of refuges, increasing per capita refuge availability and relaxing DDD mortality relative to prey on patch reefs, where the patch edge could prevent such refuge sharing. These hypotheses lead to a synthetic framework to predict expected mortality patterns for a variety of scenarios. For nonsocial, nonaggregating species and species that aggregate in order to take advantage of spatially clumped refuges, IDD mortality is possible but likely superseded by DDD refuge competition, especially on patch reefs. By contrast, for species that aggregate socially, mortality should be IDD at the scale of individual aggregations but DDD at larger scales. The results of nearly all prior reef fish studies fit within this framework, although additional work is needed to test many of the predicted outcomes. This synthesis reconciles some apparent contradictions in the recent reef fish literature and suggests the importance of accounting for the scale‐sensitive details of predator and prey behavior in any study system.",

Key words: attraction–production; coral reefs; density dependence; habitat selection; reef fish; settlement; settlement shadow. INTRODUCTION The spatial configuration, quality, and size of habitat patches can determine the distribution and abundance of organisms by affecting colonization, movement, and the strength of species interactions (MacArthur and Wilson 1967, Hanski 1998). Understanding the role of habitat is particularly important in light of tremendous variation in habitat availability, driven by both natural (Porter 1972, Gardner et al. 2005, Silliman et al. 2005, Bruno et al. 2007) and anthropogenic (e.g., Barel et al. 1985, Skole and Tucker 1993, Bellwood et al. 2004) causes. Environmental change often involves the loss (or gain) of a biogenic habitat critical to the persistence of other organisms. Thus, many restoration techniques focus on reestablishing the structural attributes of a system (e.g., trees or corals) based on the Field-of- Dreams Hypothesis: ‘‘if you build it, they will come’’ (a reference to the 1989 movie [Palmer et al. 1997]). This concept may be useful in understanding the response of species to restoration of degraded habitat, but it also may provide a valuable foundation for understanding the dynamics of species more generally, especially in response to natural fluctuations in habitat availability. The Field-of-Dreams Hypothesis proposes that in- creased habitat availability will lead to a proportionate increase in colonists, with no resulting decrease in density at previously existing sites. Alternatively, new habitat may simply redirect colonists away from other suitable sites (Carr and Hixon 1997, Osenberg et al. 2002b): the Propagule Redirection Hypothesis. Propa- gule redirection may create settlement shadows (sensu Jones 1997) and unintentionally contribute to the further degradation of existing sites by removing potential colonists (Osenberg et al. 2002b). However, if postcolonization processes are density dependent, then redirection may still enhance the population by amelio- rating deleterious effects of density in existing habitat. The net effect of redirection will depend on the strength of density dependence, the overall level of colonization, and the magnitude of propagule redirection (Osenberg et al. 2002b). Effects of propagule redirection on the response of populations to altered habitat availability also will depend upon connectivity, temporal scale, and habitat quality (Resetarits 2005, Resetarits and Binckley 2009) (seeDiscussionfor more detail). Studies of larval depletion by predators in which a ‘‘wall of mouths’’ (predators) reduce settlement to downstream habitats (Gaines and Roughgarden 1987, Hamner et al. 1988, Peterson and Black 1991) provide compelling evidence that biological processes can modify patterns of larval settlement.

Page 2826 MS#09-1993 2826 R eports context, foraging studies of pollinators suggest that the addition of flowers can lead to reductions in local density of the pollinators (reviewed in Mitchell et al. 2009). There are, however, few experimental studies of the effects of habitat on colonization per se. In one of the best examples, Resetarits (2005) examined oviposi- tion by a tree frog (Hyla chrysoscelis) in relation to sets of pools that varied in the proportion of sites with predators. Oviposition was greater in predator-free ponds that had the fewest number of neighboring ponds with predators, demonstrating selective oviposition at both local and landscape scales. However, this work did not directly address redirection of ovipositing females (and their eggs), because the fates of the females (and their eggs) that could have oviposited at sites with some predator-containing ponds, but chose not to, were unknown. Did they perish, or were they redirected to other pools? In contrast, Resetarits and Binckley (2009), working with aquatic beetles, also varied the number of pools, keeping composition fixed. They found a proportionate increase in colonization rates as the number of pools increased, corroborating the Field-of- Dreams Hypothesis. However, this seminal (and to date, unique) study did not examine or extrapolate their results to postcolonization dynamics. Propagule redirection is particularly relevant in species with demographically open local populations in which organisms must find and colonize new sites during each generation, and where colonists have the potential to colonize many possible sites. This phenomenon is particularly relevant to many benthic marine organisms, whose propagules are capable of dispersing long distances over short periods of time. For example, the majority of reef fishes have a bipartite life history, with pelagic larvae that disperse tens to hundreds of kilometers from their natal site. Here, we (1) report a field test of the Propagule Redirection and Field-of-Dreams Hypotheses for coral reef fishes, (2) parameterize a model that integrates our observed levels of propagule redirection and previous experimental estimates of density dependence to evalu- ate the implications of propagule redirection on fish recruitment (i.e., postcolonization dynamics), and (3) use the model to assess the relative importance of increased colonization, propagule redirection, and re- duced density dependence on fish recruitment. M ATERIALS ANDMETHODS Study site and species We conducted fieldwork on the northern shore of Moorea, French Polynesia (17830 0 S, 149850 0 W), a shallow lagoon with interspersed sand and reef inside a barrier reef (Galzin and Pointer 1985). Our experiment had two treatments (high vs. low habitat availability) arranged in 12 experimental blocks. To assess the effects of habitat availability on redirection we used a ‘‘competition’’ design, in which we monitored settlement to focal habitat that either did or did not have neighboring sites ‘‘competing’’ for larvae. Each location was an open sand flat (at a depth of;4 m) with no other hard-bottom habitat, so that each treatment would receive approximately equal larval input within a block without influences from neighboring natural reefs. To make our experimental arrays as uniform as possible, we constructed 168 Standardized Habitat Units (e.g., Forrester 1990) by attaching colonies ofPocillo- pora verrucosa(;15 cm diameter) to cinder blocks (one coral colony per cinder block) using Z-spar marine epoxy (Splash Zone Compound, Kopcoat, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, USA). Each of 12 sites (i.e., statistical blocks) contained one replicate of each treatment and consisted of 14 SHUs. Pairs of focal SHUs for each treatment were placed 16 m apart (and perpendicular to the dominant current direction, with at least 15 m to the nearest natural reef). We then surrounded one pair of focal SHUs by 10 single SHUs arranged in a 2 m diameter circle (see Appendix A for a diagram). This constituted the ‘‘high habitat’’ treatment. In the ‘‘low habitat’’ treatment, the two focal SHUs lacked neigh- bors. The Field-of-Dreams andPropagule Redirection Hypotheses differ in their predictions about the input of colonists (settlement) as well as the longer-term effects on recruitment (i.e., establishment of older life stages). Because the presence of older life stages (or hetero- specifics) can modify settlement patterns (e.g., Schmitt and Holbrook 1996), we quantified and removed settlers on a daily basis (as described in the next paragraph). This allowed us to unambiguously evaluate the key prediction that distinguishes the Field-of-Dreams and Propagule Redirection Hypotheses: i.e., does added habitat proportionally increase settlement or simply redistribute settlers? However, this approach precluded us from quantifying subsequent postsettlement recruit- ment patterns. We therefore used existing data on the strength of postsettlement ",

KeywordsDendropoma maximum Pocillopora  Symbiosis Trapezia Introduction Understanding the ecological processes governing the persistence and demography of stony corals is among the most fundamental goals of coral reef ecology. The positive species interactions between corals and their microbial, invertebrate, and fish inhabitants are of particular impor- tance to predicting the ability of corals to persist in a rapidly changing environment. The majority of work on mutualisms involving stony corals has focused on their relationship with endosymbiotic zooxanthellae. Yet, mu- tualisms involving other symbionts are not uncommon and may be of great importance in shaping the response of corals to environmental conditions. For example, Stac- howicz and Hay (1999) found that competition between macroalgae and the temperate coralOculina arbusculacan be mitigated by a coral-associated crab,Mithrax forceps, which consumes algae and prevents algal overgrowth. Several species of coral crabs (e.g.,TrapeziaandTetralia) live among the branches of corals (e.g.,Pocilloporaand Acropora) in the tropical Pacific and have been shown to increase coral survivorship (Glynn1983) through the alleviation of deleterious effects of sedimentation (Stewart et al.2006) and predatory seastars (Glynn1976; Pratchett and Vytopil2000; Pratchett2001). Benefits attributable to guard crabs may extend beyond defense against coral predators and sedimentation. The vermetid snail,Dendropoma maximumis sessile and extrudes a mucous net for feeding. Previous observa- tional studies suggest vermetids can have negative effects on coral growth and morphology (Smalley1984; Colgan Communicated by Ecology Editor Prof. Mark Hay A. C. Stier (&) C. S.

Effects of vermetids are particularly deleterious for the branching coral,Pocillopora cf. verrucosa, which com- monly co-occurrs with vermetids atop massivePorites reefs, and provides critical habitat for many fishes and invertebrates, including several species of guard crabs (obligate symbiotic crabs that live in the interstitial spaces of the coral) (Glynn1976). One such guard crab,Trapezia serenei, lives among the branches of pocilloporid corals, and it is known to protect corals (e.g., Stewart et al.2006). However, the role of guard crabs with respect to vermetid- coral interactions remains unknown. Importantly, past experiments on vermetid-Pocilloporainteractions (Shima et al.2010) were done on small coral fragments that lacked guard crabs. The deleterious effects of vermetids are likely induced by contact with the mucous net (Shima et al. 2010), suggesting that guard crabs might reduce the observed effects of vermetids on corals by cleaning the corals of vermetid mucus (as they do sediments). Using a field experiment that manipulated presence/absence of vermetid snails (primarilyDendropoma maximum) and guard crabs (Trapezia serenei), this study tested whether guard crabs ameliorate the negative effects of vermetids on Pocilloporagrowth. Materials and methods A field experiment was conducted to explore the separate and joint effects of vermetids and guard crabs on the growth rate of small colonies ofPocillopora. Twenty patch reefs (mean size 15.55 m 2 ,SD=4.07), comprised pre- dominately of massivePoritessp. and containing abundant vermetids were selected in the northern lagoon of Moorea, French Polynesia (17°30 0 S, 149°50 0 W). On 10 of the 20 patch reefs, all vermetids were removed from their shell by placing a hooked wire between the wall of the shell and snail and extracting the snail; on the remaining reefs, vermetids were not manipulated. Forty colonies ofPocil- lopora(each approximately 10 cm in diameter) that lacked vermetids but contained at least one pair of guard crabs were collected from the reef flat near the Richard B. Gump research station in Moorea. In half of the coral colonies (n=20), wooden skewers were used to remove all exo- symbionts, while in the remaining colonies (n=20) exo- symbionts were removed selectively, leaving only a pair of T. serenei. Irrespective of treatment, all 40 experimental Pocilloporacolonies were similarly handled to equalize potential handling effects. The starting size (i.e., skeletal mass) of each experimentalPocilloporacolony was esti- mated using a buoyant weight technique (Davies1989). TwoPocilloporacolonies (one withTrapeziaand one without) were transplanted onto each of 20Poritespatch reefs (n=10 with vermetids removed,n=10 with ver- metids present). AllPocilloporacolonies were positioned onPoritesreefs within the neighborhood (\\2 cm) of the mucous net of at least one vermetid (mean±1 SD number of vermetids withC5 mm aperture diameter per 500 cm 2 centered onPocilloporacolony: 5.02±3.05) or within similar distances to an empty vermetid shell (for the ver- metid removal treatment). Colonies ofPocilloporawere attached to the patch reefs within PVC collars (10 cm in diameter and 2 cm in height) that were affixed to the reef using A-788 splash zone epoxy (Z-spar). Each collar was transected by three stainless steel bolts (evenly spaced around the circumference) and tightened to secure the coral in place. The experiment was maintained for 40 days, and all corals were checked weekly to evaluate potential immigration and emigration of guard crabs. All corals with guard crabs retained their crabs, and all corals in the treat- ment without crabs remained crab-free for the duration of the study. After 40 days, corals were returned to the labo- ratory and final skeletal mass was measured (Davies1989). Data analysis Because corals are modular organisms,Pocilloporagrowth was estimated assuming an exponential model:G=[(ln (M f /M i ))/t], whereM f is the final skeletal mass,M i is the initial skeletal mass, andtis the duration of the study (days). The paired nature of the experimental design (Pocilloporacolonies with- and without guard crabs were paired on individualPoritesreefs) violates the assumption of independence for classical ANOVA. Therefore, the effects of guard crabs on coral growth were evaluated as the difference in growth of corals of paired colonies on each of the twenty reefs, with- and without guard crabs, calculated as:dG=G crab -G no crab . Thet-tests were used to test three specifica priori(and orthogonal) hypotheses: 1.The beneficial effect of guard crabs is greater in the presence vs. absence of vermetids. Rephrased in the context of a statistical null hypothesis: H 0,V-,V? : dG V- =dG V? . 2.Guard crabs do not affect the growth ofPocilloporain the absence of vermetids (H 0,v- :dG V- =0). 3.Guard crabs increase coral growth in the presence of vermetids (H 0,v? :dG V? =0). Results and discussion The effect ofTrapeziaon coral growth was significantly greater in the presence of vermetids than in the absence Coral Reefs 123 (Fig.1:t 18,V-,V? =2.22,P=0.039). There was no effect of guard crabs onPocilloporagrowth in the absence of vermetids (t 9,V- =0.670,P=0.52); however, in the presence of vermetids, guard crabs increasedPocillopora growth by 100% (t 9,V? =2.86,P=0.019). Phrased dif- ferently, the effect of vermetids depended upon the pres- ence or absence of guard crabs. In the absence of a pair of guard crabs, vermetids reduced the daily growth rates of Pocilloporaby 50% (Fig.1), which was a similar magni- tude as observed by Shima et al. (2010). However, in the presence of guard crabs, vermetids had no demonstrable effect on coral growth, suggesting that guard crabs com- pletely ameliorated the deleterious effects of vermetids. It is unlikely that guard crabs in the experiment attacked vermetids directly. Surveys quantifying vermetid densities (a 500 cm 2 quadrat centered on eachPocilloporacolony) at the beginning and end of the experiment found equiva- lent densities of vermetids, providing no evidence that crabs were killing snails. Additionally, observers con- ducting weekly censuses ofPocilloporafound no evidence that guard crabs were leaving their coral colonies to interact with the snails. Instead, it is speculated that guard crabs mitigated the deleterious effects of vermetids on corals by (1) consuming vermetid mucus, (2) inadvertently dislodging mucus during their movements, and/or (3) actively removing mucus vi",

INTRODUCTION Coral reefs are biologically diverse habitats that provide important ecosystem services including coastal fish- eries, and protection against storms, tsunamis and rising sea levels (Pratchettet al. 2008). Corals also play an important ecological function, providing bio- genic structures for many species of fishes and other invertebrates (Joneset al. 2004). However, consider- able evidence suggests that the abundance and physiological performance of reef building corals is declining in many areas (Gardneret al. 2003; Bellwood et al. 2006), potentially jeopardizing many of their ecosystem services. Recent studies of coral dynamics have focused on a limited set of factors, including hurricanes (Woodley et al. 1981), competitors (e.g. algae:Carpenter & Edmunds 2006; Box & Mumby 2007), conspicuous predators (e.g. crown-of-thorns sea star,Done 1992; fishes,Coleet al. 2008) and mutualists (Pratchett et al. 2000). Other studies have identified anthropo- genic activities (e.g. nutrient enrichment,Brunoet al. 2003; sedimentation,McCullochet al. 2003; and dis- ease,Harvellet al. 2002; Brunoet al. 2003)as drivers of coral declines. These factors undoubtedly contribute to coral dynamics in many locations and times, but given the diversity of species and biological interactions that comprise coral reef ecosystems (and the relatively limited breadth of scientific study), it is likely that coral dynamics might be influenced by species interactions still unrecognized by scientists. Although coral reefs are largely known for their more charismatic inhabitants, many small, relatively cryptic species (e.g. small invertebrates) are potentially impor- tant players but easily overlooked. For example, vermetid gastropods are sessile and feed via extruded mucus nets that often contact neighbouring substrates, including corals (Morton 1965; Hughes & Lewis 1974). The largest vermetid,Dendropoma maximum (see electronic supplementary material, appendix A), is common and widespread throughout the Indo-Pacific (Hadfieldet al.1972; Hughes & Lewis 1974 ; Zv uloni et al.2008), and aspects of its feeding ecology have been examined by a number of workers (e.g.Smalley 1984; Kappneret al.2000; Ribaket al.2005; Gagern et al.2008). In the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea), the pres- ence ofD. maximumwas correlated with morphological anomalies and reduced size in a branching coral (Zvuloniet al.2008). Here, we explore vermetid – coral interactions in more detail using a series of field observations combined with experiments designed to quantify the degree to which vermetids cause reductions in growth and survival of four coral species. 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS (a)Field surveys We surveyed 90 interspersed patch reefs in a shallow (2 – 3 m) lagoon of Moorea, French Polynesia (17.488S and 149.818W). Each reef was comprised entirely of a single massivePorities lobatacoral colony (see electronic supplementary material, appendix B for dis- cussion of coral taxonomy). We recorded reef morphology (binary response variable: either ‘flattened’ or ‘rugose’, see electronic sup- plementary material, appendix A, figure A1c) from a distance of approximately 5 m (where reef morphology was apparent but the presence of vermetids was not). We then surveyed each reef under closer inspection and recorded the presence or absence of vermetids. We evaluated the relationship between coral morphology and vermetid presence – absence using a x 2 test. We quantified covariation between vermetid densities and the proportion of the reef substrate that was dead (i.e. hard substrate other than live coral) in 103, 22.36 22.36 cm quadrats hap- hazardly placed on monotypic patches of four focal species (electronic supplementary material, appendix B) of common reef- building coral:Porites lobata(n¼37),Pocillopora(n¼26),Porites rus(n¼20) andMontipora(n¼20). We visually estimated the pro- portion of coral substrate that was dead, and counted the number of vermetids that were greater than or equal to 5 mm in aperture diam- eter (i.e. readily identifiable asD. maximum). We evaluated variation in vermetid densities among substrate types using ANOVA, and relationships between the proportion of dead substrate and vermetid density using least-squares linear regression. (b)Field experiments We conducted six field experiments to quantify the effects of verme- tid gastropods on skeletal growth and survival of four focal coral species:Porites lobata,P. r u s,Pocillopora,Montiporaat a site in Mahar- epa lagoon, and on two of these species (P. lobataandPocillopora)at another site (West Temae lagoon). Focal corals (juvenileP. lobata; fragments from larger colonies for other species) were attached to plastic bases (approx. 10 10 cm) using epoxy and weighed (Davies 1989).

We randomly selected half of the 12 study reefs within each experiment (n¼6) and removed vermetids. The remaining reefs comprised a control group (n¼6) (vermetids were present at ambient densities). Focal corals were weighed in the laboratory, transplanted in triplicate to each reef and secured to galvanized staples (previously affixed to the reef) using plastic cable ties. All experiments were initiated between 2 June and 10 June 2006. Our observations after transplant- ing corals showed that most corals were directly contacted by mucus nets in the treatments, where vermetids were not removed, in a manner similar to what we have observed with naturally occurring corals. Focal corals were collected after 47 days, returned to the labora- tory and reweighed to assess growth (as change in skeletal mass: Davies 1989). Following weighing, all corals were immediately returned to their original location on experimental reefs. On 13 Jan- uary 2007 (after 217 – 225 days), the proportion of coral surface area alive was estimated visually by a single observer in the field. The effects of vermetids on focal corals in each experiment were analysed using a nested-ANOVA (three corals/reef; six replicate reefs per treatment). 3. RESULTS The presence of vermetids was strongly associated with growth anomalies of the reef-building coral,P. lobata (table 1). Large vermetids (i.e. individuals.5mm aperture diameter) occurred on all four focal substrates, although their densities varied (F 3,99 ¼ 12.85,p,0.0001): vermetids were most common on Montipora(5.70 per 500 cm 2 ; s.d. 2.87) andP. lobata (3.81; s.d. 4.45) and least common onP. r u s(1.35; s.d. 2.",

      "abstractExtracted": "Both habitat complexity and priority effects can influence the strength of competitive interactions; however, the independent and synergistic effects of these processes are not well understood. In Moorea, French Polynesia, we conducted a factorial field experiment to quantify the independent and combined effects of priority effects and habitat complexity on the strength of intraspecific compet- itive interactions among recently settled individuals of a coral reef fish (Thalassoma quinquevittatum: Labridae). Simultaneous arrival of focal individuals with competitors resulted in a 2.89-fold increase in survival relative to reefs where focal individuals arrived 5 days later than competi- tors (i.e., a priority effect). Increasing habitat complexity resulted in a 1.55-fold increase in survivorship when focal individuals arrived simultaneously with or before compet- itors. However, increasing habitat complexity did not affect the survivorship of focal individuals arriving 5 days later than competitors. Behavior observations showed that sur- vivorship was negatively correlated with aggression. Aggression by prior residents towards focal individuals was significantly greater when focal individuals arrived 5 days later than competitors than when they arrived simulta- neously.

Stier Received: 24 June 2009 / Accepted: 18 December 2009 / Published online: 6 January 2010 ÓSpringer-Verlag 2010 AbstractBoth habitat complexity and priority effects can influence the strength of competitive interactions; however, the independent and synergistic effects of these processes are not well understood. In Moorea, French Polynesia, we conducted a factorial field experiment to quantify the independent and combined effects of priority effects and habitat complexity on the strength of intraspecific compet- itive interactions among recently settled individuals of a coral reef fish (Thalassoma quinquevittatum: Labridae). Simultaneous arrival of focal individuals with competitors resulted in a 2.89-fold increase in survival relative to reefs where focal individuals arrived 5 days later than competi- tors (i.e., a priority effect). Increasing habitat complexity resulted in a 1.55-fold increase in survivorship when focal individuals arrived simultaneously with or before compet- itors. However, increasing habitat complexity did not affect the survivorship of focal individuals arriving 5 days later than competitors. Behavior observations showed that sur- vivorship was negatively correlated with aggression. Aggression by prior residents towards focal individuals was significantly greater when focal individuals arrived 5 days later than competitors than when they arrived simulta- neously. Increasing habitat complexity did not reduce aggression. Our results suggest that, when competitors arrive simultaneously, competitive interactions are weak and subordinates are not displaced from complex habitat; increasing habitat complexity increases survival by dis- rupting predation. Conversely, when competitors arrive at different times, aggression intensifies and increasing habitat complexity does not disrupt predation because competitive subordinates are excluded from habitat resources. This study demonstrates that the strength of competition can be context-dependent and may vary with the timing of com- petitive interactions and habitat complexity. KeywordsCompetition Habitat complexity  Interaction strengths Priority effects Reef fish Introduction Historically, empirical and theoretical studies quantifying interaction strengths have been heavily biased towards predatory, competitive and top–down versus bottom–up interactions. Typically, these studies describe interaction strengths by constants or functions that depend on the densities of the interacting individuals, species, functional groups, or cohorts (e.g., Peacor and Werner2004). More recently, renewed calls have been made for more studies examining how the context within which interactions occur (e.g., disturbance regime: Gallet et al.2007; higher-order interactions: Peacor and Werner2004; and environmental attributes: Chase2007; Crain et al.2004) shapes interaction strengths (Agrawal et al.2007). For example, the impor- tance of competition in structuring rocky intertidal com- munities can vary spatially depending on levels of larval Communicated by Ross Alford.

The magnitude of competition may also vary depending upon the provi- sioning of structural refuge in complex habitats (e.g., Bonin et al.2009), or the sequence in which competitors arrive in a community (i.e., priority effects; e.g., Alford and Wilbur 1985). The intensity of priority effects can in turn depend upon the amount of time that separates the arrival of competitors in a community (Geange and Stier2009), or the presence of predators (Louette and Meester2007). Here, we examine the potential for variation in habitat complexity and priority effects to create context-dependent competitive outcomes. Understanding the independent and combined effects of priority effects and habitat complexity on the outcome of competitive interactions is of increasing importance as global climate change leads to widespread shifts in breeding phenology and habitat availability (Both et al.2009; Durant et al.2007; Hughes2000; Parmesan and Yohe2003; Visser and Both2005; Walther et al.2002). Habitat complexity can considerably influence interac- tion strengths (e.g., competition: Bonin et al.2009; Buenau et al.2007; Ladd and Facelli2008; and predation: Beukers and Jones1997; Huffaker1958; Juliano2009). Increasing habitat complexity is typically expected to mitigate the negative effects of competition for predator free space (e.g., Almany2004a) or reverse competitive dominance relationships (e.g., Ebersole1985). More complex habitats often contain a greater diversity of food resources (e.g., Harmon et al.1986) and refuges from predators (e.g., Beukers and Jones1997; Finke and Denno2002), thereby reducing the intensity of competition and predation. Increased structural complexity may also alter encounter rates between predators and prey, increasing predation risk if the structure decreases the visibility of predators to prey, or decreasing predation risk by providing enemy-free structural refuge or interfering with predator maneuvra- bility and/or the ability to visually detect prey (Andruskiw et al.2008; Finke and Denno2006; Janssen et al.2007; Langellotto and Denno2004; Persson and Eklov1995; Rilov et al.2007; Warfe and Barmuta2004). Interaction strengths (e.g., competition and predation) can also be modified by the order (who arrives first) and timing (by how much) of arrival in a community (i.e., ‘‘priority effects’’: e.g., Alford and Wilbur1985; Dayton and Fitzgerald2005; Geange and Stier2009; Lawler and Morin1993; Price and Morin 2004; Shorrocks and Bingley 1994). Early arrival may confer experience advantages if individuals gain knowledge of the local environment (e.g., greater awareness of established boundaries with neighbors and knowledge of predator-free space), facilitating their ability to acquire resources, defend home ranges, or evade predators. Alternatively, if larger size confers competitive advantages, early-arriving individuals may have a growth advantage over late-arriving individuals. When early arrival provides a competitive advantage due to differences in experience or size, the competitive effect of the early- arriving individuals on the later-arriving individuals should increase as arrival times diverge (Alford and Wilbur1985; Geange and Stier2009). However, many species undergo extensive ontogenetic niche shifts which are often mani- fested as shifts in habitat use or diet with increasing size (Werner and Gilliam1984). Such shifts can substantially alter interaction strengths within communities (de Roos et al.2002; Werner1992; Werner and Gilliam1984). For example, individuals arriving at different times may interact less intensely than individuals arriving at the same time because they are, to some degree, acting as separate ecological species (Maiorana1978). As a result, priority effects will only be important if ontogenetic niche shifts occur slowly, so that late-arriving individuals interact with larger, more experienced early-arriving individuals. Con- versely, when rapid ontogenetic niche shifts occur, the optimal strategy for an individual to avoid intracohort priority effects is to either: (1) enter the community before other settlers; or (2) enter the community late enough that prior settlers have undergone ontogenetic niche shifts and no longer pose a competitive threat. Finally, habitat complexity and priority effects may interact, so that the effects of one process depend upon a second process. For example, although the magnitude of competition may increase as individuals arrive in a com- munity progressively later than their competitors, late- arriving individuals may be released from competition or predation pressure in complex habitats that decrease encounter rates with early-arriving individuals. Under- standing how both habitat complexity and priority effects independently and synergistically affect the strength of competitive interactions is essential to estimates and interpretation of the strength of competition. The few studies that have examined the combined effects of habitat and arrival time on the strength of com- petition (see Fincke1999; Sunahara and Mogi2002) have identified habitat as capable of moderating inhibitory pri- ority effects. In a previous study examining two labrid species that are closely related both genetically and func- tionally (Thalassoma hardwickeandT. quinquevittatum), we identified strong intracohort priority effects (Geange and Stier2009). Aggression toward later-arriving individ- uals by early-arriving individuals increased as each species entered communities progressively later than its competi- tor. Additionally, aggression by early-arriving individuals and the survival of late-arriving individuals was negatively correlated, suggesting that the timing of arrival relative to competitors results in context-dependent competitive out- comes. Here, focussing on intraspecific competitive effects, we manipulated habitat complexity and timing ofThalas- soma quinquevittatumsettler arrival to: (1) determine the 112Oecologia (2010) 163:111–118 123 Author's personal copy independent effects of timing of arrival and habitat com- plexity on intraspecific competition betweenT. quinque- vittatumsettlers; and (2) address whether habitat complexity attenuates or enhances intraspecific interac",

KeywordsCoral reef fish Moorea Predation  Recruitment Species diversity Introduction Spatiotemporal variation in patterns of recruitment in benthic marine fish communities are driven by a diverse suite of factors including oceanographic currents that drive larval supply and post-settlement processes such as com- petition and predation (Jones1991; Steele1997; Schmitt et al.1999; Shima1999; Hixon and Jones2005). A number of studies have documented high rates of predation in reef fishes immediately following settlement (reviewed in Almany and Webster2006). Most studies on predation in coral reef fishes have focused on how predation affects recruitment rates or population dynamics of one or a few species and have revealed that predation often regulates prey populations by causing density-dependent mortality (reviewed in Hixon and Webster2002). Fewer studies have focused on how entire prey assem- blages are structured by predation. Predators can reduce species diversity without affecting the relative abundance of prey species by indiscriminant foraging (e.g., Hixon and Beets1993). Greater reductions in diversity coupled with changes in relative abundance occur when predators feed selectively on rare species (i.e., an oddity effect: Almany and Webster2004; Almany et al.2007); whereas, smaller reductions in diversity coupled with changes in relative abundance occur when predators target abundant prey species (e.g., Webster and Almany2002).

The current study examined the influence of both resident and transient predators on the composition, abun- dance, and diversity of juvenile reef fishes in Moorea, French Polynesia by monitoring natural recruitment to small patch reefs exposed to or protected from predators. Materials and methods This study was conducted in the backreef of Cook’s Bay, Moorea, French Polynesia (17°3 0 S, 149°50 0 W). Moorea is encircled by a barrier reef that forms a system of shallow lagoons (mean depth*6 m) characterized by small patch reefs interspersed with sand (Galzin and Pontier1985), which provides a relatively uniform habitat with generally high settlement of coral reef fishes (Planes et al.1993). A matrix of reefs (3 rows97 reefs) was placed parallel to shore on a sandflat (3.5 m deep). Each reef was separated from one another and natural reefs by at least 15 m of open sand. Reefs were constructed of livePocillopora cf. verru- cosacoral heads (30±1.3 cm diameter, 20±5.3 cm high; mean±SE) placed on concrete blocks using Z-Spar marine epoxy. Each of the 21 reefs was randomly assigned to one of three treatments: full cage (-predators), no cage (?predators), or partial cage (cage control) (n=7 per treatment). Coral size did not differ between treatments (F 1,19 =0.11,P=0.89). Predator-exclosure cages were constructed of 1-cm 2 mesh galvanized steel wire. Cages were placed over the reefs and attached to two pieces of rebar (1 cm diameter) driven 0.5 m into the sand on opposite sides of the reef. Full cages (75 cm tall970 cm diameter) completely enclosed the reef, effectively excluding most piscivorous fishes, but allowed settling fishes to pass through. Partial cages (70 cm diameter950 cm tall and elevated*20 cm above the sand) were open at the top and bottom to allow access to all piscivore guilds (resident or transient), while partially controlling for the presence of the cage (Steele 1996; Connell1998). Recruitment was measured over a 54-day period during the 2008 austral summer (14 February to 8 April), a period of relatively high recruitment in Moorea. Surveys were conducted every 3–7 days during the first 25 days of the experiment, but after that only a single final survey was conducted at 54 days, due to logistical constraints. During each survey, SCUBA divers identified and counted coral reef fish recruits on each reef. To characterize the relative abundance of predatory species during the duration of the study, the number of piscivorous fishes were counted within 1 m of each reef and also along three 10091m band transects extending along each row of the reef array. Predator surveys were conducted during all but the final recruit survey. Fishes were categorized as predators based on Holbrook and Schmitt (2002), who used diver obser- vations and videotape to identify the main predators of small reef fishes in Moorea. All cages were scrubbed of fouling organisms 2 days prior to each survey so as not to disturb fishes during the surveys, although no significant algal growth was noted within the cages during the experiment. The effect of predators on total recruit abundance (i.e., all species pooled) was modeled using a generalized linear model with a log link function. Because the data were counts, they approximated a Poisson error distribution. However, data exhibited overdispersion (residual devi- ance=53.09, residualdf=18), therefore a quasi-Poisson error distribution was assumed. A one-way analysis of deviance (ANODEV) with orthogonal contrasts tested the effects of predators on total recruit abundance. ANODEV is analogous to ANOVA, but examines differences in deviance rather than variance using likelihood ratio tests to compare two nested models, allowing flexibility in the assumed underlying error distribution. Two orthogonal contrasts tested the effect of cage treatments on recruit abundance: the first tested for cage artifacts (cage control versus no cage) and the second tested the effects of pre- dators (cage versus no cage and cage control) in the absence of cage artifacts. Due to a predominance of zeros in the data, two sample permutation tests were subse- quently used to test for both family-specific effects of predators on recruitment and cage artifacts at the family level. Predator-exposed treatments (no cage and cage control reefs) were pooled for all analyses since cage artifacts were not detectedfor recruit abundance (t 1,18 =0.47,P=0.64; Figs.1,2), species richness (t 1,18 =0.301,P=0.76,Fig.3a),rarefiedrichness (Fig.3b), nor abundance at the family level (P[0.87, Fig.2). All statistical analyses were conducted on data collected from the final survey (day 54) using R statistical software (R Development Core Team2009). Effects of predators on recruit diversity were examined for both species richness and rarefied species richness, to explore possible mechanisms of predator effects on diver- sity. The effect of predators on non-rarefied richness was modeled similarly to effects on abundance, using a gen- eralized linear model with a log link and a Poisson distri- bution (overdispersion parameter assumed=1, residual deviance=19.01, residualdf=18). A one-way ANO- DEV with orthogonal contrasts tested the effects of caging on non-rarefied species richness (cage artifact: cage control versus no cage; predator effect: cage versus no cage and cage control). Rarefaction analysis was used to standardize species richness to a comparable number of individuals (Gotelli and Colwell2001). Rarefaction curves were gen- erated using community analysis software EstimateS 528Coral Reefs (2010) 29:527–532 123 Author's personal copy (Colwell2006). Comparison of the curves revealed whe- ther predator effects on diversity were driven by simply reducing abundance or by selective foraging behavior of predators (Almany and Webster2004).

Key words: attraction–production; coral reefs; density dependence; habitat selection; reef fish; settlement; settlement shadow. INTRODUCTION The spatial configuration, quality, and size of habitat patches can determine the distribution and abundance of organisms by affecting colonization, movement, and the strength of species interactions (MacArthur and Wilson 1967, Hanski 1998). Understanding the role of habitat is particularly important in light of tremendous variation in habitat availability, driven by both natural (Porter 1972, Gardner et al. 2005, Silliman et al. 2005, Bruno et al. 2007) and anthropogenic (e.g., Barel et al. 1985, Skole and Tucker 1993, Bellwood et al. 2004) causes. Environmental change often involves the loss (or gain) of a biogenic habitat critical to the persistence of other organisms. Thus, many restoration techniques focus on reestablishing the structural attributes of a system (e.g., trees or corals) based on the Field-of- Dreams Hypothesis: ‘‘if you build it, they will come’’ (a reference to the 1989 movie [Palmer et al. 1997]). This concept may be useful in understanding the response of species to restoration of degraded habitat, but it also may provide a valuable foundation for understanding the dynamics of species more generally, especially in response to natural fluctuations in habitat availability. The Field-of-Dreams Hypothesis proposes that in- creased habitat availability will lead to a proportionate increase in colonists, with no resulting decrease in density at previously existing sites. Alternatively, new habitat may simply redirect colonists away from other suitable sites (Carr and Hixon 1997, Osenberg et al. 2002b): the Propagule Redirection Hypothesis. Propa- gule redirection may create settlement shadows (sensu Jones 1997) and unintentionally contribute to the further degradation of existing sites by removing potential colonists (Osenberg et al. 2002b). However, if postcolonization processes are density dependent, then redirection may still enhance the population by amelio- rating deleterious effects of density in existing habitat. The net effect of redirection will depend on the strength of density dependence, the overall level of colonization, and the magnitude of propagule redirection (Osenberg et al. 2002b). Effects of propagule redirection on the response of populations to altered habitat availability also will depend upon connectivity, temporal scale, and habitat quality (Resetarits 2005, Resetarits and Binckley 2009) (seeDiscussionfor more detail). Studies of larval depletion by predators in which a ‘‘wall of mouths’’ (predators) reduce settlement to downstream habitats (Gaines and Roughgarden 1987, Hamner et al. 1988, Peterson and Black 1991) provide compelling evidence that biological processes can modify patterns of larval settlement.

Page 2826 MS#09-1993 2826 R eports context, foraging studies of pollinators suggest that the addition of flowers can lead to reductions in local density of the pollinators (reviewed in Mitchell et al. 2009). There are, however, few experimental studies of the effects of habitat on colonization per se. In one of the best examples, Resetarits (2005) examined oviposi- tion by a tree frog (Hyla chrysoscelis) in relation to sets of pools that varied in the proportion of sites with predators. Oviposition was greater in predator-free ponds that had the fewest number of neighboring ponds with predators, demonstrating selective oviposition at both local and landscape scales. However, this work did not directly address redirection of ovipositing females (and their eggs), because the fates of the females (and their eggs) that could have oviposited at sites with some predator-containing ponds, but chose not to, were unknown. Did they perish, or were they redirected to other pools? In contrast, Resetarits and Binckley (2009), working with aquatic beetles, also varied the number of pools, keeping composition fixed. They found a proportionate increase in colonization rates as the number of pools increased, corroborating the Field-of- Dreams Hypothesis. However, this seminal (and to date, unique) study did not examine or extrapolate their results to postcolonization dynamics. Propagule redirection is particularly relevant in species with demographically open local populations in which organisms must find and colonize new sites during each generation, and where colonists have the potential to colonize many possible sites. This phenomenon is particularly relevant to many benthic marine organisms, whose propagules are capable of dispersing long distances over short periods of time. For example, the majority of reef fishes have a bipartite life history, with pelagic larvae that disperse tens to hundreds of kilometers from their natal site. Here, we (1) report a field test of the Propagule Redirection and Field-of-Dreams Hypotheses for coral reef fishes, (2) parameterize a model that integrates our observed levels of propagule redirection and previous experimental estimates of density dependence to evalu- ate the implications of propagule redirection on fish recruitment (i.e., postcolonization dynamics), and (3) use the model to assess the relative importance of increased colonization, propagule redirection, and re- duced density dependence on fish recruitment. M ATERIALS ANDMETHODS Study site and species We conducted fieldwork on the northern shore of Moorea, French Polynesia (17830 0 S, 149850 0 W), a shallow lagoon with interspersed sand and reef inside a barrier reef (Galzin and Pointer 1985). Our experiment had two treatments (high vs. low habitat availability) arranged in 12 experimental blocks. To assess the effects of habitat availability on redirection we used a ‘‘competition’’ design, in which we monitored settlement to focal habitat that either did or did not have neighboring sites ‘‘competing’’ for larvae. Each location was an open sand flat (at a depth of;4 m) with no other hard-bottom habitat, so that each treatment would receive approximately equal larval input within a block without influences from neighboring natural reefs. To make our experimental arrays as uniform as possible, we constructed 168 Standardized Habitat Units (e.g., Forrester 1990) by attaching colonies ofPocillo- pora verrucosa(;15 cm diameter) to cinder blocks (one coral colony per cinder block) using Z-spar marine epoxy (Splash Zone Compound, Kopcoat, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, USA). Each of 12 sites (i.e., statistical blocks) contained one replicate of each treatment and consisted of 14 SHUs. Pairs of focal SHUs for each treatment were placed 16 m apart (and perpendicular to the dominant current direction, with at least 15 m to the nearest natural reef). We then surrounded one pair of focal SHUs by 10 single SHUs arranged in a 2 m diameter circle (see Appendix A for a diagram). This constituted the ‘‘high habitat’’ treatment. In the ‘‘low habitat’’ treatment, the two focal SHUs lacked neigh- bors. The Field-of-Dreams andPropagule Redirection Hypotheses differ in their predictions about the input of colonists (settlement) as well as the longer-term effects on recruitment (i.e., establishment of older life stages). Because the presence of older life stages (or hetero- specifics) can modify settlement patterns (e.g., Schmitt and Holbrook 1996), we quantified and removed settlers on a daily basis (as described in the next paragraph). This allowed us to unambiguously evaluate the key prediction that distinguishes the Field-of-Dreams and Propagule Redirection Hypotheses: i.e., does added habitat proportionally increase settlement or simply redistribute settlers? However, this approach precluded us from quantifying subsequent postsettlement recruit- ment patterns. We therefore used existing data on the strength of postsettlement ",

KeywordsCyanobacteria!Gymnodoris ceylonica! Lyngbya majuscula!Stylocheilus striatus! Trophic cascade Introduction Cyanobacteria are an important, but understudied member of coral reef ecosystems capable of affecting reef ecosys- tem structure, function, and services. In recent years, blooms of cyanobacteria (Lyngbya majuscula), driven by a combination of increasing water temperatures and eutro- phication, have increased in size and frequency (Elmetri and Bell2004; Ahern et al.2008; Paul2008). Cyanobac- terial blooms form large, dense mats in coral reef and associated habitat (Elmetri and Bell2004; Paul et al.2005; Watkinson et al.2005; Ahern et al.2008). For example, Stielow and Ballantine (2003) recorded a cyanobacterial density of 600 g dw m -2 on shallow seagrass beds of the Caribbean Sea in Puerto Rico during 1998–2000. Cyano- bacterial mats can have a range of deleterious effects on reefs and local human populations, including smothering corals and seagrass, inhibition of coral recruitment, killing fish, and skin, eye and respiratory irritation (Osborne et al. 2001; Elmetri and Bell2004; Kuffner and Paul2004; Watkinson et al.2005). The longevity of cyanobacterial blooms is thought to be enhanced by the production of active secondary metabolites that chemically deter gener- alist herbivores including crabs, sea urchins, and fish (Thacker et al.1997; Nagle and Paul1998,1999; Osborne et al.2001); however, some herbivorous sea hares can tolerate these toxins and are therefore capable of grazing on cyanobacteria. The herbivorous sea hare (Stylocheilus striatus) exhibits strong settlement and dietary preferences for cyanobacteria (Switzer-Dunlap and Hadfield1977; Capper et al.2006). Dense swarming aggregations of sea hares often form in cyanobacterial blooms (Paul and Pennings1991; Pennings and Paul1993a; Capper and Paul2008).

Such large aggregations ofS. striatusare capable of consuming hectare-sized fields of cyanobacteria in days (Pennings and Paul1993b). The rapid consumption of cyanobacteria may, in turn, reduce its negative effects on the reef; however, for this to be realized, sea hares must avoid predators. Although fish predators may be deterred by chemical defences sea hares sequester from cyanobac- teria (Pennings et al.2001), nudibranchs (Gymnodoris ceylonica) can withstand these defences. Nudibranchs are voracious predators of sea hares that increase in abundance within cyanobacterial blooms shortly after sea hares become abundant, and are capable of rapidly reducing the density of sea hares (Gosliner et al.1996). Thus, these three species comprise a simple food chain (predator: nudi- branchs, herbivore: sea hares, and primary producer: cyanobacteria; Fig.1) that can potentially influence cyanobacterial dynamics; however, there are currently no empirical studies examining these relationships. Here, a series of laboratory experiments explore the effects of predation of sea hares by nudibranchs and the potential for cascading effects on cyanobacteria through release from herbivory. First, the predatory behaviour of nudibranchs relative to sea hare density is described. Sec- ond, the effect of sea hare size on predation risk is exam- ined. Finally, the indirect effect of nudibranchs on cyanobacteria is tested. Methods This research was conducted in 2008 at the Gump Biolog- ical Research Station, Moorea, French Polynesia (17°30 0 S, 149°50 0 W). All experiments were conducted in plastic containers (190 mm9190 mm990 mm; W9L9H). To allow the exchange of fresh seawater,*80% of the surface area of the lids, and two opposing sides of con- tainers were cut away and covered with 0.5 mm mesh screening. Containers were placed within large (2,670 l) outdoor flow-through seawater tanks (10 containers per tank). In each experiment, sea hares, nudibranchs, and cyanobacteria were collected from the field. Prior to experiments, nudibranchs were starved for 3 days, and cyanobacteria were rinsed with filtered seawater, which removed associated flora or fauna. Functional response Nine density treatments (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 sea hares: mean length 20.0 mm±3.8 SD) were randomly assigned to 18 containers (n=2 per treatment), each containing one adult nudibranch (mean length 36.2 mm±5.6 SD). The number of sea hares eaten was recorded after 1 day (24 h). Attack rates and handling time were estimated using a Holling Type II functional response. Because prey organ- isms were not replaced as they were consumed, attack rate and handling time were estimated using Roger’s ‘random predator equation’ (Rogers1972; Juliano2001): N e ¼N 0 1#e aðN e h#PtÞ hi ð1Þ whereN e is the number of sea hares eaten,N 0 is the initial sea hare density (per container),a, h, andPare, respectively, the per predator instantaneous attack rate, handling time, and predator density (P=1 in this study). The duration of the experiment (t) is 1 day in this study. Following Bolker (2008) and McCoy and Bolker (2008), the random predator equation was fit using the Lambert W function (Corless et al.1996): N e ¼N 0 W ahN 0 e #aðPt#hN 0 Þ !\" ah ð2Þ A general-purpose maximum likelihood function was used to estimate the attack rate and handling time parameters from Eq.2. Nudibranchs died in three containers (sea hare densities: 6, 8, and 9), and these trials were therefore excluded from the analysis. The effects of sea hare size on predation risk Using a fully factorial design, the presence of nudibranchs (one individual present [mean length 40.5 mm±9.4 SD] vs. absent) and the size of sea hares (small [mean length 20.3 mm±1.98 SD]; medium [mean length 32.9 mm± 2.5 SD]; or large [mean length 61.7 mm±5.4 SD]) were manipulated. The six treatments were randomly assigned to - Primary Producer Herbivore Predator - + Fig. 1The three trophic levels examined.

Survival of sea hares was recorded after 15 h. Sea hares in treatments without nudibranchs exhibited 100% survival; therefore, analysis focused on effects of sea hare size in affecting survival in the presence of nudibranchs. Proportion survival of the three size classes was modelled using a generalized linear model with a quasibinomial error distribution (residual deviance= 36.73, residualdf=12) and alogitlink function. An analysis of deviance was used to test for a main effect of size, and Tukey’s post hoc comparisons were used to compare proportional survival among the three different size classes. Trophic cascade The presence of a trophic cascade was examined using three treatments: (1) cyanobacteria alone (n=16); (2) cyanobacteria and sea hares (n=8); (3) cyanobacteria, sea hares, and nudibranchs (n=8). Cyanobacteria (mean= 78.0 g, SD=12.9) were added to each of the 32 con- tainers. Ten sea hares (mean length 57.4 mm±5.6 SD) were added to containers assigned to treatments 2 and 3, and one nudibranch (mean length 48.6 mm±3.6 SD) was added to containers assigned to treatment 3. Each morning (*0700), the number of surviving sea hares in each con- tainer was recorded. Nudibranch densities were maintained at their original density by replacing any missing or dead nudibranchs throughout the duration of the study (two nudibranchs were replaced on day two, and no other replacements were necessary). After 4 days, cyanobacterial biomass (g) and the number of sea hares in each container were recorded. A Wilcoxon rank sum test, with continuity correction, was used to test whether nudibranchs significantly reduced the number of sea hares. Finding nudibranchs significantly reduced sea hare abundance; the indirect effect of sea hare predation on cyanobacteria (i.e., a trophic cascade) was examined. Due to the short duration of the experiment, there was no discernable growth of cyanobacteria in ",

Key words: community dynamics; competition; competitive lotteries; coral reef fish; intracohort competitive interactions; Moorea, French Polynesia; priority effect; recruitment; settlement;Thalassoma spp. INTRODUCTION Many communities undergo repeated periods of development due to regenerating resources or pulsed arrival of young-of-year (e.g., Gibbs and Grant 1987, Schauber et al. 2002). Because numerous species are highly fecund (e.g., many insects, plants, fishes, and marine invertebrates), with females producing thou- sands of offspring, individuals often enter communities in large pulses. Further, species often enter communities asynchronously due to interspecific differences in phenology, with the competitive pressures faced by early-arriving individuals differing markedly from late- arriving individuals. In such instances, the degree to which one individual affects the success of another depends, in part, on both the sequence (who arrives first) and timing (by how much) of arrival of each individual into the community (i.e., ‘‘priority effects’’). Priority effects may reflect interspecific differences in breeding phenology, which can be adaptive to, among other things, interspecific interactions. For example, compet- itive intensity may be less when a subordinate compet- itor breeds before or simultaneously with a superior competitor. In such cases, priority effects simply refer to interspecific interactions whose outcomes depend on the relative or absolute timing of arrival, breeding, or activity of the interacting species (Lawler and Morin 1993). There are at least two general types of priority effects: one in which per capita competitive effects are constant but long-term dynamics are dependent on initial conditions and the other in which timing of arrival alters the strength of per capita competitive effects. The Lotka-Volterra competition model exemplifies the first type. When each species suffers more from inter- than from intraspecific competition, the equilibrium outcome of competition is dependent upon initial conditions, with the species with a sufficiently large initial abundance having the advantage and excluding the other species. In this scenario, an early-arriving species can build up to sufficiently high numbers that it excludes the invasion of the other species. Reversals in sequence of arrival can reverse the competitive outcome. In the other type, the strength of competition varies according to conditions under which competition is occurring, i.e., the per capita strength of competition is not constant. For example, if early arrival provides a competitive advantage due to differences in experience or size, then the competitive effect of the early-arriving Manuscript received 3 April 2008; revised 18 November 2008; accepted 7 January 2009. Corresponding Editor: M. H. Carr. 3 E-mail: Shane.Geange@vuw.ac.nz 2868 species on the later-arriving species should increase as the arrival times diverge. In either case, knowledge of such temporal effects is critical to estimates and interpretation of realized interaction strengths of com- petitors in a community. In this study, we are concerned with the second type of priority effect, how sequencing and timing of arrival change the strength of competition. The direction and magnitude of priority effects will depend on the underlying processes that give rise to the effect. For example, if initial size differences or the time available for resource preemption confers an advantage upon a competitor arriving in a community early, performance of late-arriving competitors should decline as they arrive progressively later than the early-arriving competitor (e.g., Lawler and Morin 1993). Alternatively, when species are of similar size, differences in arrival time can affect the duration of head-to-head competition, in which case performance of late-arriving competitors should increase as they arrive progressively later than the early-arriving competitor (Lawler and Morin 1993). Intracohort priority effects, which we define here as occurring within the same settlement season, have previously been shown to affect community dynamics, having been documented in protist (Price and Morin 2004), zooplankton (Louette and Meester 2007), insect (Benke 1978, Shorrocks and Bingley 1994), and am- phibian communities (Lawler and Morin 1993, Blaustein and Margali 1996, Dayton and Fitzgerald 2005). In marine systems, work on intracohort order of arrival has predominantly focused on sessile invertebrates (e.g., Sutherland and Karlson 1977). However, reef fish communities are also a good platform for testing the influence of (1) changes in the timing of arrival and (2) reversals in the sequence of arrival, because they conform to repeated periods of development driven by pulsed arrival of young-of-the-year. The majority of reef fishes have two-phase life histories, consisting of a dispersive planktonic larval phase and benthic, reef-associated juvenile and adult phases. Given the dispersive nature of the planktonic larval phase, most reef fish communities are relatively open, relying on spatially and temporally unpredictable larval supply from external populations for colonizing juveniles. At high latitudes (.108N/S), recruitment patterns are typically seasonal, producing strong cohorts (Doherty 1988, 1991, Srinivasan and Jones 2006). Conversely, at low latitudes, longer breeding seasons are usually associated with lower fecundities (Wine- miller and Rose 1992), reducing the potential for strong cohorts. As individuals within a cohort make the transition from planktonic to benthic habitat, they encounter individuals that have settled in previous cohorts (i.e., established residents) and other recently settled individuals from the same cohort, with both intra- and intercohort interactions capable of determin- ing the success of a newly arrived individual. To date, the majority of research examining priority effects in reef fishes has focused on intercohort effects of established residents on the success of later-arriving individuals (for examples, see Shulman et al. 1983, Sweatman 1985, Almany 2003, 2004, Munday 2004). These studies have demonstrated that the recruitment success of newly arrived juveniles is strongly influenced by interactions with established residents and for the most part have concluded that strong interaction strengths add a degree of determinism to future community structure when the influence of prior residents on later-arriving individuals is species specific. A fundamental endeavor of ecologists is evaluating interaction strengths among species and the consequenc- es for community structure and dynamics and how communities will respond to changes in the biotic environment. However, this type of information is only useful if we can identify the variability of interaction strengths across space and time. Here, we expand on previous research into the effects of established residents on new arrivals (i.e., intercohort effects) by examining the effect subtle differences in timing and order of arrival have on the recruitment success of individuals within the same cohort. Specifically, we examine intra- cohort priority effects between two competing reef fishes (Thalassoma hardwickeandT. quinquevittatum). Using experimental manipulations, we tested whether the strength of competitive interactions depends on the sequence and temporal separation of arrival of compet- ing individuals. We predicted that: (1) when symmetrical intracohort priority effects occur (and not generic competitive effects), reversing the order of arrival should reverse the observed effects (i.e., effects should be a function of order of arrival and not species identity); and (2) when priority effects (rather than species effects) are most important, competitive effects should be weakest when competitors arrive simultaneously and increase in strength as temporal separati",

When an individual’s persistence in a community depends upon the strength of competitive interactions, changes in the timing of arrival relative to the arrival of a competitor can modify competitive strength and, ultimately, establishment in the community.

Because numerous species are highly fecund (e.g., many insects, plants, fishes, and marine invertebrates), with females producing thou- sands of offspring, individuals often enter communities in large pulses. Further, species often enter communities asynchronously due to interspecific differences in phenology, with the competitive pressures faced by early-arriving individuals differing markedly from late- arriving individuals. In such instances, the degree to which one individual affects the success of another depends, in part, on both the sequence (who arrives first) and timing (by how much) of arrival of each individual into the community (i.e., ‘‘priority effects’’). Priority effects may reflect interspecific differences in breeding phenology, which can be adaptive to, among other things, interspecific interactions. For example, compet- itive intensity may be less when a subordinate compet- itor breeds before or simultaneously with a superior competitor. In such cases, priority effects simply refer to interspecific interactions whose outcomes depend on the relative or absolute timing of arrival, breeding, or activity of the interacting species (Lawler and Morin 1993). There are at least two general types of priority effects: one in which per capita competitive effects are constant but long-term dynamics are dependent on initial conditions and the other in which timing of arrival alters the strength of per capita competitive effects. The Lotka-Volterra competition model exemplifies the first type. When each species suffers more from inter- than from intraspecific competition, the equilibrium outcome of competition is dependent upon initial conditions, with the species with a sufficiently large initial abundance having the advantage and excluding the other species. In this scenario, an early-arriving species can build up to sufficiently high numbers that it excludes the invasion of the other species. Reversals in sequence of arrival can reverse the competitive outcome. In the other type, the strength of competition varies according to conditions under which competition is occurring, i.e., the per capita strength of competition is not constant. For example, if early arrival provides a competitive advantage due to differences in experience or size, then the competitive effect of the early-arriving Manuscript received 3 April 2008; revised 18 November 2008; accepted 7 January 2009. Corresponding Editor: M. H. Carr. 3 E-mail: Shane.Geange@vuw.ac.nz 2868 species on the later-arriving species should increase as the arrival times diverge. In either case, knowledge of such temporal effects is critical to estimates and interpretation of realized interaction strengths of com- petitors in a community. In this study, we are concerned with the second type of priority effect, how sequencing and timing of arrival change the strength of competition. The direction and magnitude of priority effects will depend on the underlying processes that give rise to the effect. For example, if initial size differences or the time available for resource preemption confers an advantage upon a competitor arriving in a community early, performance of late-arriving competitors should decline as they arrive progressively later than the early-arriving competitor (e.g., Lawler and Morin 1993). Alternatively, when species are of similar size, differences in arrival time can affect the duration of head-to-head competition, in which case performance of late-arriving competitors should increase as they arrive progressively later than the early-arriving competitor (Lawler and Morin 1993). Intracohort priority effects, which we define here as occurring within the same settlement season, have previously been shown to affect community dynamics, having been documented in protist (Price and Morin 2004), zooplankton (Louette and Meester 2007), insect (Benke 1978, Shorrocks and Bingley 1994), and am- phibian communities (Lawler and Morin 1993, Blaustein and Margali 1996, Dayton and Fitzgerald 2005). In marine systems, work on intracohort order of arrival has predominantly focused on sessile invertebrates (e.g., Sutherland and Karlson 1977). However, reef fish communities are also a good platform for testing the influence of (1) changes in the timing of arrival and (2) reversals in the sequence of arrival, because they conform to repeated periods of development driven by pulsed arrival of young-of-the-year. The majority of reef fishes have two-phase life histories, consisting of a dispersive planktonic larval phase and benthic, reef-associated juvenile and adult phases. Given the dispersive nature of the planktonic larval phase, most reef fish communities are relatively open, relying on spatially and temporally unpredictable larval supply from external populations for colonizing juveniles. At high latitudes (.108N/S), recruitment patterns are typically seasonal, producing strong cohorts (Doherty 1988, 1991, Srinivasan and Jones 2006). Conversely, at low latitudes, longer breeding seasons are usually associated with lower fecundities (Wine- miller and Rose 1992), reducing the potential for strong cohorts. As individuals within a cohort make the transition from planktonic to benthic habitat, they encounter individuals that have settled in previous cohorts (i.e., established residents) and other recently settled individuals from the same cohort, with both intra- and intercohort interactions capable of determin- ing the success of a newly arrived individual. To date, the majority of research examining priority effects in reef fishes has focused on intercohort effects of established residents on the success of later-arriving individuals (for examples, see Shulman et al. 1983, Sweatman 1985, Almany 2003, 2004, Munday 2004). These studies have demonstrated that the recruitment success of newly arrived juveniles is strongly influenced by interactions with established residents and for the most part have concluded that strong interaction strengths add a degree of determinism to future community structure when the influence of prior residents on later-arriving individuals is species specific.

We quantified the effects of clove oil, a commonly usedfish anesthetic, on the growth and occurrence of bleaching in three species of corals:Acropora striata,Pocillopora verrucosa, and Porites australiensis. We compared coral responses tofive treatments: a gradient of four clove oil concentrations (0-28%) in seawater, and one concentration of clove oil (14%) in ethanol. Each week, we assessed the presence of bleaching, and then applied the treatment. We measured growth over the duration of the 6-week experiment using the buoyant weight technique. Growth and bleaching showed a dose response to clove oil exposure, and the use of ethanol as a solvent had an additional deleterious effect, as also suggested by observed changes in concentrations of eugenol followingfield application. Overall, growth was reduced by 37.6% at the highest concentration (28% clove oil in seawater) relative to the control (0% clove oil). The reduction in growth was nearly as great (35.3% of the control) at half the concentration of clove oil (14%) when dissolved in ethanol. These results suggest the repeated use of clove oil (even without a solvent) can deleteriously affect corals. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecological systems in the world (Paulay, 1997). To study this diversity biologists often use anesthetics to immobilizefishes and invertebrates for collection, sampling, or experimental removal (Marnane, 2000; Ackerman and Bellwood, 2002; Depczynski and Bellwood, 2004; Wilson, 2005; Valles et al., 2006; Shima et al., 2006, 2008). Field applications of an anesthetic can be particularly useful on rugose or complex reefs where cryptobenthicfish and invertebrates would otherwise remain ensconced (Depczynski and Bellwood, 2004). For somefield experi- ments, anesthetics have been applied repeatedly to the same coral or patch reef to chronically removefish (e.g.,Wilson, 2005; Munday, 2004; Shima et al., 2008). While substantial research has investigated the efficacy and side effects of common anesthetics onfish and humans, there has been relatively little effort to determine their effects on other coral reef organisms, including the corals themselves. For example, some anesthetics, such as quinaldine, MS-222, 2- phenoxyethanol and benzocaine are limited in their use because of concerns about their health effects on humans orfish (Lewis et al., 1985; Clark, 1990; Brown, 1992). In contrast, clove oil (derived from the plantEugenia caryophyllata)is generally believed to have few health concerns and is used in many countries as a topical anesthetic for humans (Soto and Burhanuddin, 1995). Clove oil varies in its composition, but consists of the phenol eugenol (the active ingredient, making up 70-98% by weight) (Isaacs,1983) as well as eugenol acetate (N17%), and kariofilen 5 (~12%) (Isaacs, 1983; Soto and Burhanuddin, 1995). Although potentially safe for humans, the environmental effects of clove oil on reef biota have not been well studied (but see Mulochau and Durville, 2004; Frisch et al., 2007). Many researchers use alcohols or detergents as dissolving agents because clove oil does not easily emulsify with water without vigorous agitation (Munday and Wilson,1997)(Table 1). Thus, even if clove oil is not harmful, the dissolving agent itself, or the combination of chemicals, may haveharmfuleffectsonreef organisms.Forexample,Mulochauand Durville (2004)found that a clove oil / ethanol mixture reduced the growth and increased the mortality of the branching coral,Pocillopora verrucosa. However, these results do not distinguish the effects of clove oil from those of alcohol. More importantly, somefield researchers do not use ethanol ordetergents due to expense orlimited access in remote field locations (Table 1), yet the environmental effects of clove oil emulsified in seawater have never been studied. Repeated application of anesthetics to the same reefs is often required to maintain experimental manipulations (e.g.,Munday, 2004; Wilson, 2005), block experiments through time using the same reefs (e.g.,Shima et al., 2008) or describe long-term settlement patterns of small or cryptic species (e.g., Stier and Osenberg, unpublished). Collectors of marine ornamentals might also repeatedly apply anesthetics if they frequent the same collection sites to gather fish for the aquarium trade. Previous studies of the impact of clove oil on corals have addressed single applications using single species of Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology 369 (2009) 53–57 ⁎Corresponding author.

Thus, there remains a need to 1) assess the effects of repeated exposure of corals to anesthetics, and 2) conduct such a study using multiple species of corals to assess the generality of any observed response. Here, we compare the response of three species of branching corals to repeated exposure of clove oil (City Chemical LLC, West Haven, CT) consisting of 98% eugenol. Our focal taxa,Acropora striata, Pocillopora verrucosa,andPorites australiensis, are all common in the lagoons of French Polynesia (Done et al., 1991; Gleason, 1996; Berumen and Pratchett, 2006). We tested four concentrations of clove oil in seawater (0, 7, 14, or 28% clove oil). We also tested one concentration of clove oil in alcohol (14%) to facilitate comparisons with existing studies. We utilized coral fragments (Birkeland, 1976) to reduce variation in responses and thus increase the power of our experi- mental design. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study Site and Experimental Design Fieldwork was conducted on the northern side of Moorea, French Polynesia (17°30′S, 149°50′W) in Vaipahu lagoon (for a general description, seeGalzin and Pointier, 1985). To reduce environmental heterogeneity within the study site, we chose a wide sandy portion of the lagoon with a water depth ranging from 4 to 6 m. We arranged forty-five cinderblocks in three rows of 15 with distances of 3 m between rows and columns (Fig.1). For each of the three coral species, we collected nubbins (branch fragments) from three different colonies spaced at least 10 m apart to help ensure genotypic variation. Collection sites were chosen for their similarity in depth, light and flow to the study area. Small voucher samples were taken from each colony, bleached, and species identity verified microscopically by examining morphology (Veron, 2000). On each of three consecutive days, we collected 15 similarly sized nubbins from one colony (genotype) of each species in the early morning, transported nubbins to the lab, mounted them on 7.0×7.5 cm square grids of small (1.5×1.25 cm) plastic mesh vexar using Z-spar™epoxy (Splash Zone Compound, Kopcoat, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA), and marked them by inscribing a unique label into the Z-spar™.AftertheZ-spar™had cured (approx. 3 h), we determined the buoyant weight of each nubbin (Davies, 1989) and deployed them to the study site in the afternoon. One nubbin from each of the 3 species was attached to each of 15 cinderblocks, grouped by genotype to block for variation inflow, and the relative position of species on cinderblocks was assigned at random (seeFig. 1). We attached a cage made of large (2.5×2.5 cm) square plastic vexar over each cinderblock to prevent predation by corallivores. Other studies conducted using a similar mesh-size demonstrated no difference in growth or survival for nubbins in cages versus cage-controls within a given treatment (White, unpublished). We applied cages to all cinderblocks so any possible effects of cages would not confound our results. This design used 135 nubbins (15 replicates from three Table 1 Summary offield studies using clove oil to study tropical reeffish Targeted Fish SpeciesNumber (Frequency) of ApplicationsConcentration of clove oil a SolventReference multiple tropicalfish7 times (14 days)20%ethanolDepczynski and Bellwood (2004) multiple tropicalfish3 times (1 year)23%ethanolAckerman and Bellwood (2002) Salarias patzneri1 timenot statedethanolWilson (2004) multiple tropicalfish1 time10%ethanolVigliola and Meekan (2002) Neopomacentrusfilamentosus14 times (1 day)10%ethanolVigliola et al.
