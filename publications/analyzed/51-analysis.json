    "summary": "Researchers studied how predatory fish affect the tiny, hidden creatures living inside coral colonies, finding that predators dramatically reduce the abundance and diversity of beneficial animals that help corals survive.",
    "keyQuestion": "How do predatory fish that live inside coral colonies affect the abundance, diversity, and composition of the small creatures that also live there and provide important services to the coral?",
    "approach": "The researchers surveyed 93 coral colonies to map natural predator distributions, then conducted a controlled experiment with 60 coral colonies, removing all small animals and adding different combinations of two predator species (flame hawkfish and coral crouchers) to test their effects.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "Predators reduced the total abundance of small fish and crustaceans by 34%",
      "Predators reduced species richness by 20%",
      "The two predator species had unique effects on community composition and beta diversity",
      "Predators reduced the abundance of mutualist species that provide protective services to corals"
    ],
    "stickyFact": "A single coral colony of Pocillopora damicornis can house more than 5000 crustaceans per square meter.",
    "whyItMatters": "Many of the small creatures affected by these predators are mutualists that help corals survive stressors like seastar predation, sedimentation, and disease. Since coral performance depends on both the density and diversity of these helpers, changes in predator communities could fundamentally alter how well corals cope with increasing environmental threats.",

    "newsHeadline": "Tiny Predators Living Inside Corals Could Determine Which Reefs Survive Climate Change",
    "essay": "When my colleague Matthieu Leray and I began collecting coral colonies from the reefs around Moorea, we had no idea we were about to uncover a hidden world of predator-prey dynamics that could reshape how we think about coral survival. We removed all small fish and crustaceans from 60 dome-shaped Pocillopora eydouxi corals using a low concentration of anesthetic (0.02% clove oil) to minimize coral stress, then transplanted them to a sandy lagoon floor and began one of the most comprehensive experiments ever conducted on coral cryptofauna.\n\nWe wanted to understand something that had never been properly tested: how do the predatory fish living inside corals affect all the other tiny creatures sharing that same space? Most coral reef research focuses on the big, obvious stuff—the colorful fish, the dramatic bleaching events, the tourist-friendly charisma. But the real diversity lives in the shadows. A single coral colony can house more than 5000 crustaceans per square meter, and many of these inconspicuous animals provide crucial services to their coral hosts. We decided to focus on two common predators that live strictly within Pocillopora corals: flame hawkfish and coral crouchers, both ambush hunters that rarely venture beyond their coral homes.\n\nThe results were stark. Predators reduced the total abundance of fish and crustacean prey by 34%. They cut species richness by 20%. Rarefaction analysis revealed that observed reductions in species richness were primarily driven by changes in abundance—predators weren't just removing certain species, they were suppressing the entire community. Most troubling, each predator species affected community composition differently, creating unique patterns of winners and losers among the prey.\n\nWhat surprised us most was how dramatically predators affected the mutualist species—the beneficial crabs, shrimp, and small fish that actually help corals survive. We knew from previous work that certain Trapezia crabs and Alpheus shrimp defend corals against crown-of-thorns seastars, clear away sediment, and remove harmful mucus-producing snails. Damselfish provide oxygen and nutrients.\n\nThis matters because coral performance depends heavily on both the density and diversity of these mutualist communities. Previous studies have shown that corals do better with more mutualists and with more diverse mutualist assemblages. The density and identity of predators present within P. eydouxi may substantially alter coral performance in the face of increased frequency and intensity of natural and anthropogenic stressors. Understanding these microscale interactions is crucial for comprehending one of the ocean's most complex ecosystems."
