    "essay": "When my colleagues and I mapped the global reach of marine research stations, we discovered something remarkable: some of our observation sites have been quietly collecting data for decades. Some sites have records stretching back to the early 1900s. These aren't just numbers in a database—they represent an unbroken chain of scientific observation that predates our modern understanding of climate change.\n\nWe wanted to understand whether the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network, or ILTER, could serve as a platform for global coastal and ocean observation. Working with Nicholas Nidzieko, Alicia Acosta, and colleagues from around the world, we analyzed how this network of 44 countries and 700 research sites—more than 100 of which are in coastal and marine environments—might address the pressing challenges of climate change and human impacts on ocean ecosystems. We used a SWOT analysis to examine the network's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\n\nOur analysis revealed that ILTER's coastal and marine sites are distributed globally from tropical-equatorial to polar regions, creating what we recognized as a true global observing system. These coastal and marine sites measure a broad variety of abiotic and biotic environmental variables, from temperature and species richness to productivity changes and biodiversity alterations. Some of these sites include data records that precede ILTER's formal establishment in 1993, giving us invaluable long-term baselines for understanding environmental change.\n\nWhat struck us most was the untapped potential we found. While ILTER sites are committed to free and open data sharing following FAIR principles—Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable—putting these principles into practice remains challenging at most sites. The network has developed tools to harmonize measurements and methods, yet coordination between sites and with external initiatives needs improvement. We also discovered an imbalance similar to other observing systems: physical observations dominate while biological and ecological observations lag behind.\n\nThis matters because human activities threaten both the natural functioning of coastal and marine ecosystems and their sustainable use by future generations. Developing the ecological knowledge necessary to quantify these threats requires exactly what ILTER offers: sustained, long-term observations that integrate biological, physical, geological, and biogeochemical aspects of ecosystems. The Global Ocean Observing System has recognized this need by establishing Biology and Ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables, and ILTER is uniquely positioned to contribute.\n\nOur analysis points toward a future where ILTER's coastal and marine component could significantly enhance global ocean observation, but only if we address present challenges. We need better coordination among sites, improved data sharing infrastructure, and stronger integration with initiatives like the Global Ocean Observing System. The question isn't whether these long-established observation networks can contribute to understanding our changing oceans—it's whether we can organize them effectively enough to realize their full potential before it's too late."
