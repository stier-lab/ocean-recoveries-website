    "essay": "We recognized that conservation has celebrated remarkable predator recovery stories: wolves returning to Yellowstone, sea otters reclaiming Pacific coastlines. But research by Kristin Marshall, Adrian Stier, Jameal Samhouri, Ryan Kelly, and Eric Ward reveals an uncomfortable truth: successful predator recovery often creates new conservation headaches.\n\nWe reviewed cases where recovering predators came into conflict with other conservation goals. The patterns were striking. In the Pacific Northwest, recovering harbor seals and sea lions now consume millions of salmon, including runs listed under the Endangered Species Act. Managers face the impossible choice of protecting one recovering species or another. Legal frameworks designed to prevent species extinction provide little guidance when protected species conflict.\n\nSimilar dilemmas arise with fisheries. As marine mammal populations recover, they consume fish that humans also want. Commercial and recreational fisheries that adapted to decades of reduced competition now face new pressures. The conflict isn't just economic: fisheries often support coastal communities with few alternative livelihoods.\n\nPerhaps most troubling, ecosystems may not return to historical baselines even when predators recover. Climate change, habitat alteration, and shifts in prey communities mean that recovering predators encounter different worlds than their ancestors inhabited. A recovered sea otter population may not restore kelp forests if water temperatures have exceeded tolerance limits for kelp.\n\nWe argue that conservation success requires anticipating these conflicts rather than being surprised by them. Management frameworks need mechanisms for navigating trade-offs between conservation goals that may prove incompatible. This doesn't diminish the value of predator recovery, but it does mean that recovery marks the beginning of new management challenges rather than the end of conservation concerns.\n\nAs more predator populations recover, these dilemmas will multiply. Developing adaptive frameworks for managing recovered predators alongside other conservation priorities becomes increasingly urgent."
