    "summary": "Scientists studied Pacific herring populations around Haida Gwaii, British Columbia over 65 years to understand how fishing, climate, and population changes affected the stability of interconnected herring groups that historically provided reliable resources to predators and fishermen.",
    "keyQuestion": "What are the relative roles of population growth, climate, and fishing in driving changes in local and regional herring populations, and how has the spatial asynchrony (different timing of population booms and busts) changed over time?",
    "approach": "Researchers analyzed 65 years (1950-2015) of herring spawn surveys and fishing catch records from 11 subpopulations around Haida Gwaii archipelago using a Bayesian state-space model to track population dynamics and measure how synchronized the different groups became over time.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "The herring portfolio eroded over time - populations that used to boom and bust at different times became more synchronized",
      "There was a severe decline in herring population growth over the 65-year period",
      "Commercial harvest played a key role, with typical annual exploitation rates around 15% at the archipelago scale, but local harvest rates reached as high as 65% when fishing occurred",
      "The Pacific Decadal Oscillation and population growth had equally strong effects on both local and regional herring population dynamics"
    ],
    "stickyFact": "Local herring harvest rates reached as high as 65% when fishing occurred, even though the typical annual exploitation rate across the entire archipelago was around 15%.",
    "whyItMatters": "This research shows how interconnected populations that provide stability and reliable resources can fundamentally change and lose their buffering capacity. The findings suggest that finer-scale management strategies may be needed to restore the spatial population asynchrony that historically provided regional resource reliability, though this would require higher implementation and monitoring costs.",

    "essay": "When I first looked at 65 years of herring data from the remote archipelago of Haida Gwaii, I saw something troubling: a natural insurance system was falling apart. My colleagues Andrew Shelton, Jameal Samhouri, Blake Feist, Phillip Levin and I had assembled records from 1950 to 2015 showing how Pacific herring populations across 11 locations around these British Columbia islands had fundamentally changed. What once was a portfolio of populations that boomed and busted at different times—providing reliable resources to predators and fishermen even when individual groups crashed—had become dangerously synchronized.\n\nWe wanted to understand what was driving this transformation. Were commercial fisheries to blame? Climate shifts? Or something else entirely? To find out, we built a Bayesian state-space model that could tease apart the relative effects of fishing pressure, environmental changes, and population growth on both local herring groups and the archipelago as a whole. We used spawn surveys and catch records from traditional spawn-on-kelp fisheries and other fisheries.\n\nThe results painted a clear picture of decline. We documented a severe decline in herring population growth over the 65-year period, along with the erosion of the herring portfolio itself. Commercial harvest had historically played a key role in herring dynamics, with typical annual exploitation rates hovering around 15% across the archipelago. But when we looked closer, local harvest rates told a different story—they reached as high as 65% when fishing occurred in specific areas. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation and population growth had equally strong effects on both local and regional population dynamics, showing that climate and internal population processes were just as important as human activities.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how the portfolio effect—nature's way of spreading risk across space—had eroded so dramatically. We expected to find some changes, but the extent of synchronization was striking. The complexity of these interactions remains one of the biggest challenges in marine population biology.\n\nThis matters because herring are a cultural keystone species for indigenous peoples and a central node in Northeast Pacific food webs that support top predators. When populations become synchronized, they lose their ability to buffer against regional collapse—if one crashes, they all crash together. Our results suggest that developing herring management strategies at a finer spatial scale may help recover previous levels of spatial population asynchrony and ensure greater regional resource reliability, though this would require higher implementation and monitoring costs.\n\nThe big question now is whether we can reverse this process. Can management interventions restore the natural asynchrony that once made these herring populations so resilient? The herring of Haida Gwaii may hold lessons for managing spatially structured populations worldwide, but first we need to understand whether portfolio erosion is reversible or represents a permanent shift in how these coastal ecosystems function."
