## PRIORITY 3: Generic "Research" Images Being Overused

The following images are used multiple times as fallbacks and could benefit from more specific alternatives:

| Image | Times Used | Better For |
|-------|------------|------------|
| `scuba-divers-shark-deep-blue.JPG` | 12 posts | Predator/shark papers only |
| `barracuda-school-underwater-blue.jpg` | 7 posts | Fish school/predator papers |
| `tropical-island-aerial-view-lagoon-reef.jpeg` | 5 posts | Aerial/landscape reef papers |
| `green-sea-turtle-swimming-blue.JPG` | 5 posts | Turtle/megafauna papers |

## Quick Wins: Already Have Better Images

These posts could be improved by swapping to existing images:

1. **Galápagos sharks** → Use `marine-iguana-galapagos-beach.jpg`
2. **Large carnivore recoveries** → Use `CheetahFam-1.jpg` or `Leopard-1-2.jpg` or `blacktip-reef-shark-swimming.jpg`
3. **California Current** → Use `california-sheephead-kelp-forest.jpeg` or `california-coastline-rocky-shore.jpg`
4. **Coral-dwelling fish/bleaching** → Use `damselfish-single-coral-closeup.jpeg`
5. **Kelp foundation species** → Use `kelp-forest-fish-school-underwater.jpeg` (currently using `giant-kelp-sunlight-underwater.jpeg` which is also good)
