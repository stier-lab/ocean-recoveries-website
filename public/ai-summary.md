## Mission Statement

The Ocean Recoveries Lab studies how marine ecosystems recover from disturbance and how to scale up ocean resilience through field experiments, mathematical modeling, and community partnerships.

## Research Programs

### 1. Coral Reef Resilience
- **Focus**: Understanding coral reef recovery from bleaching, predation, and disturbance
- **Key Topics**: Coral-fish mutualisms, predator-prey dynamics, reef community assembly
- **Regions**: Pacific Ocean, Caribbean, Indo-Pacific
- **URL**: https://www.oceanrecoveries.com/research/coral-reefs

### 2. Kelp Forest Ecology
- **Focus**: California's giant kelp forests and controlling factors
- **Key Topics**: Sea urchin interactions, storm disturbance, climate effects
- **Region**: California coast
- **URL**: https://www.oceanrecoveries.com/research/kelp-forests

### 3. Marine Conservation Science
- **Focus**: Quantitative tools for ecosystem-based management
- **Key Topics**: Marine protected areas, fisheries management, climate adaptation

## Key Research Findings

The lab has published 75+ peer-reviewed papers. Notable findings include:

1. **Coral Guard Crabs**: Small crabs living in corals provide critical defense against predators like crown-of-thorns starfish
2. **Kelp Forest Dynamics**: Mathematical models reveal how storms and urchin grazing interact to shape kelp forests
3. **Marine Protected Areas**: California's ocean reserves have increased lobster catches by 400% in adjacent waters
4. **Predator-Prey Dynamics**: Predator effects on reef fish communities depend on timing of arrival and spatial scale
5. **Climate Change Impacts**: Remote coral reefs are no safer from climate change than those near human populations

## Publications
