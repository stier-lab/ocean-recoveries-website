## About This Site
name: Ocean Recoveries Lab
type: Academic Research Laboratory
institution: University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)
department: Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology (EEMB)
location: Santa Barbara, California, USA

## Mission
The Ocean Recoveries Lab studies how marine ecosystems recover from disturbance and how to scale up ocean resilience. We combine field experiments, mathematical modeling, and community partnerships to understand coral reef and kelp forest dynamics.

## Research Focus Areas
1. **Coral Reef Resilience**: Understanding how coral reefs recover from bleaching, predation, and other disturbances. Key topics include coral-fish mutualisms, predator-prey dynamics, and reef community assembly.

2. **Kelp Forest Ecology**: Studying California's giant kelp forests and the factors controlling their dynamics, including sea urchin interactions, storm disturbance, and climate effects.

3. **Marine Conservation Science**: Developing quantitative tools for ecosystem-based management, marine protected area design, and climate adaptation strategies.

## Key Research Topics
- Coral reef recovery and resilience
- Kelp forest dynamics
- Predator-prey interactions in marine systems
- Species interactions and mutualisms (coral guard crabs, cleaning symbioses)
- Ecosystem-based fisheries management
- Marine protected areas effectiveness
- Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems
- Population dynamics and mathematical ecology
- Biodiversity and ecosystem function
