## Summary

Multispecies mutualisms are embedded in a network of interactions that include predation, yet the effects of predation on mutualism function have not been well integrated into mutualism theory. Where predators have been considered, the common prediction is that predators reduce mutualist abundance and, as a consequence, decrease service provision. Here, we use a mathematical model of a predatory fish that consumes two competing coral mutualists to show that predators can also have indirect posit

## Summary

Traditional methods for measuring coral growth and associated biodiversity often rely on 2D projections that can miss important structural details. This study demonstrates how 3D photogrammetry—creating detailed digital models from photographs—significantly improves our ability to accurately measure branching coral growth rates and the diversity of organisms living within their complex structures.

The improved accuracy of 3D methods is particularly important for detecting subtle changes in coral health over time and for understanding how coral architecture influences reef biodiversity.

## Why This Matters

As coral reefs face unprecedented threats from climate change, accurate monitoring is essential for conservation. Better measurement tools help scientists detect early warning signs of reef decline and evaluate the effectiveness of restoration efforts.

## Summary

Introduction Changes in temperature can fundamentally transform how species interact, causing wholesale shifts in ecosystem dynamics and stability. Yet we still have a limited understanding of how temperature-dependence in physiology drives temperature-dependence in species-interactions. For predator-prey interactions, theory predicts that increases in temperature drive increases in metabolism and that animals respond to this increased energy expenditure by ramping up their food consumption to m

## Summary

How strongly predators and prey interact is both notoriously context dependent and difficult to measure. Yet across taxa, interaction strength is strongly related to predator size, prey size and prey density, suggesting that general cross‐taxonomic relationships could be used to predict how strongly individual species interact. Here, we ask how accurately do general size‐scaling relationships predict variation in interaction strength between specific species that vary in size and density across

Standing dead structures of habitat‐forming organisms (e.g., dead trees, coral skeletons, oyster shells) killed by a disturbance are material legacies that can affect ecosystem recovery processes. Many ecosystems are subject to different types of disturbance that either remove biogenic structures or leave them intact. Here we used a mathematical model to quantify how the resilience of coral reef ecosystems may be differentially affected following structure‐removing and structure‐retaining distur

## Summary

The conservation benefits of marine reserves are well established but their contribution to adjacent fisheries via spillover is less certain and context‐dependent. Theoretical predictions do not always match empirical evidence from individual reserves, so carefully designed studies are essential for accurately assessing spillover and its contribution to fisheries. Biomass buildup within reserves, and spillover from reserve borders, also usually takes time to develop.

## Summary

Herbivores can reach extraordinary abundances in many ecosystems. When herbivore abundance is high, heavy grazing can severely defoliate primary producers and, in some cases, even drive ecosystem to undergo regime shifts from a high productivity state to a denuded, low productivity state. While the phenomenon of herbivore‐driven regime shifts is well documented, we only partially understand the mechanisms underlying these events.

## Summary

Human impacts can induce ecosystems to cross tipping points and hence unexpected and sudden changes in ecosystem services that are difficult or impossible to reverse. The world´s oceans suffer from cumulative anthropogenic pressures like overexploitation and climate change and are especially vulnerable to such regime shifts. Yet an outstanding question is whether regime changes in marine ecosystems are irreversible.

## Summary

Remote coral reefs are thought to be more resilient to climate change due to their isolation from local stressors like fishing and pollution. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the relationship between local human influence and coral community resilience. Surprisingly, we found no relationship between human influence and resistance to disturbance and some evidence that areas with greater human development may recover from disturbance faster than their more isolated counterparts.

A huge proportion of the world’s population resides in urban areas along the coast.

## Summary

A major challenge in sustainability science is identifying targets that maximize ecosystem benefits to humanity while minimizing the risk of crossing critical system thresholds. One critical threshold is the biomass at which populations become so depleted that their population growth rates become negative—depensation. Here, we evaluate how the value of monitoring information increases as a natural resource spends more time near the critical threshold.

## Summary

Many corals form close associations with a diverse assortment of coral-dwelling fishes and other fauna. As coral reefs around the world are increasingly threatened by mass bleaching events, it is important to understand how these biotic interactions influence corals' susceptibility to bleaching. We used dynamic energy budget modeling to explore how nitrogen excreted by coral-dwelling fish affects the physiological performance of host corals. In our model, fish presence influenced the functioning

## Summary

The impacts of invasive lionfish ( Pterois volitans/miles ) on native coral reef populations in the Western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea can be enormous. However, how much lionfish differ from native predators and whether their effects outweigh the abundant mesopredators that occupy many reefs invite continued examination. Here, we present empirical evidence from Caribbean Panama and beyond suggesting that lionfish are less abundant than native mesopredators.

Herbivorous fish can increase coral growth and survival by grazing down algal competitors. With coral reefs in global decline, maintaining adequate herbivory has become a primary goal for many managers. However, herbivore biomass targets assume grazing behavior is consistent across different reef systems, even though relatively few have been studied.

## Summary

A suite of processes drive variation in coral populations in space and time, yet our understanding of how variation in coral density affects coral performance is limited. Theory predicts that reductions in density can send coral populations into a predator pit, where concentrated corallivory maintains corals at low densities. In reality, how variation in coral density alters corallivory rates is poorly resolved.

Conflict is a common feature in conservation and resource management. Environmental conflicts are frequently attributed to differences in values; however, variability in the perception of facts, rooted in social and cultural differences also underlies conflicts. Such differences in perception have been termed the Rashomon effect after the Kurosawa film.

## Summary

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are designed to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services. Some MPAs are also established to benefit fisheries through increased egg and larval production, or the spillover of mobile juveniles and adults. Whether spillover influences fishery landings depend on the population status and movement patterns of target species both inside and outside of MPAs, as well as the status of the fishery and behavior of the fleet.

## Summary

Foundation species structure communities, promote biodiversity, and stabilize ecosystem processes by creating locally stable environmental conditions. Despite their critical importance, the role of foundation species in stabilizing natural communities has seldom been quantified. In theory, the stability of a foundation species should promote community stability by enhancing species richness, altering the population fluctuations of individual species, or both.

## Summary

A growing body of literature has documented myriad effects of human activities on animal behaviour, yet the ultimate ecological consequences of these behavioural shifts remain largely uninvestigated. While it is understood that, in the absence of humans, variation in animal behaviour can have cascading effects on species interactions, community structure and ecosystem function, we know little about whether the type or magnitude of human‐induced behavioural shifts translate into detectable ecolog

## Summary

Many organisms exhibit tremendous fluctuations in population abundance and experience unexpected collapse. Conservationists seeking to minimize region‐wide variability in resources and reduce extinction risk often seek to preserve a metapopulation portfolio of spatially asynchronous subpopulations connected by dispersal. However, portfolio properties are not necessarily static, and the erosion of a portfolio can fundamentally alter the population dynamics and services a species provides.

## Summary

Recent warnings from scientists suggest there is limited time to enact policies to avert wide‐ranging ecological and social damage from climate change. In the United States, discussions about comprehensive national policies to avert climate change have begun, with “Green New Deal” proposals and climate plans put forth by members of Congress and presidential candidates. Oceans are largely absent or separate from these nascent policy proposals.

## Summary

Unanticipated declines among exploited species have commonly occurred despite harvests that appeared sustainable prior to collapse. This is particularly true in the oceans where spatial scales of management are often mismatched with spatially complex metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences, and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in harvested metapopulations in three ways.

Temporally consistent individual differences in behavior impact many ecological processes. We simultaneously examined the effects of individual variation in prey activity level, covering behavior, and body size on prey survival with predators using an urchin–lobster system. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that slow‐moving purple sea urchins ( Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ) and urchins who deploy extensive substrate (pebbles and stones) covering behavior will out‐survive active urchins th

## Summary

Ocean recoveries are moving targets As the human population has grown, our demands on the ocean have increased rapidly. These demands have similarly increased the pressure we place on these systems, and we now cause considerable damage globally. If we want to maintain healthy ocean ecosystems into the future, we must learn to use ocean resources in a sustainable way and facilitate recovery in regions that have declined.

As an example of applying the evidential approach to statistical inference, we address one of the longest standing controversies in ecology, the evidence for, or against, a universal metabolic scaling relationship between metabolic rate and body mass. Using fish as our study taxa, we curated 25 studies with measurements of standard metabolic rate, temperature, and mass, with 55 independent trials and across 16 fish species and confronted this data with flexible random effects models.

## Summary

Understanding how organisms distribute themselves across fragmented landscapes is crucial for conservation planning. This study uses mathematical models to show that the spatial configuration of habitat patches—not just their total area—creates persistent patterns in occupant distributions.

Even when individuals move frequently between patches, the underlying landscape geometry leaves a lasting imprint on where populations concentrate. These findings have important implications for designing marine protected area networks and understanding reef fish community structure.

## Why This Matters

Conservation efforts often focus on total habitat area, but this research shows that how habitats are arranged spatially matters just as much. This insight can help managers design more effective protected area networks.

## Summary

Stakeholder participation is widely recognized as essential for effective marine ecosystem management. However, this study reveals a paradox: the costs associated with engaging diverse stakeholders can create institutional inertia that delays critical management decisions.

When the costs of changing course—including coordinating among stakeholders, building consensus, and navigating bureaucratic processes—exceed the perceived benefits, managers may continue suboptimal practices even when better alternatives exist.

## Why This Matters

Understanding these barriers to adaptive management is crucial for improving marine conservation outcomes. This research helps explain why some marine ecosystems remain poorly managed despite scientific evidence pointing to better approaches, and suggests strategies for overcoming institutional inertia.

    content: `Our lab has published new research in *Coral Reefs*.

## Summary

When young coral reef fish settle from the open ocean onto reefs, they face an intense period of predation pressure—a "gauntlet" that determines which individuals survive to adulthood. This study examines how this critical life stage shapes patterns of biodiversity on coral reefs.

The research demonstrates that predation during settlement can both reduce local diversity by eliminating rare species and increase diversity by preventing dominant species from monopolizing habitat. The net effect depends on predator abundance and the composition of settling fish.

## Why This Matters

Understanding how predation shapes reef fish communities is essential for predicting how reefs will respond to changes in predator populations from fishing or protection. This research provides new insights into the mechanisms that maintain coral reef biodiversity.

## Summary

When fish settle onto coral reef patches, their success depends on who got there first. This study disentangles two related but distinct effects: the influence of resident abundance (how many competitors are present) and priority effects (how long residents have been established).

Using field experiments in French Polynesia, the researchers found that both factors significantly influence colonization success, but their relative importance varies with the species involved and the competitive context. Priority effects—the advantage gained by early arrivers—can be as important as sheer numbers.

## Why This Matters

These findings help explain why some reef fish populations are predictable while others show high variability. Understanding the rules governing fish community assembly is crucial for predicting reef recovery after disturbances.

As humans continue to alter the species composition and size structure of marine food webs, it is critical to understand size-dependent effects of predators on prey. Yet, how shifts in predator body size mediate the effect of predators is understudied in tropical marine ecosystems, where anthropogenic harvest has indirectly increased the density and size of small-bodied predators. Here, we combine field surveys and a laboratory feeding experiment in coral reef fish communities to show that small

Beta diversity describes how species composition varies across space and through time. Current estimators of beta diversity typically ignore the effects of within‐patch sample size, determined jointly by local abundance and sampling effort. Many ecological processes such as immigration, predation, or nutrient limitation affect abundance and asymptotic beta diversity concurrently; thus, existing metrics may confound changes in asymptotic beta diversity with changes that result from differences in

## Summary

Predators are critical components of ecosystems. Globally, conservation efforts have targeted depleted populations of top predators for legal protection, and in many cases, this protection has helped their recoveries. Where the recovery of individual species is the goal, these efforts can be seen as largely successful. From an ecosystem perspective, however, predator recovery can introduce significant new conservation and legal challenges. We highlight three types of conflicts created by a singl

There are two broad questions that can be asked about the relationship of mutualism and community ecology: What do community interactions do for mutualisms? Conversely, what do mutualisms do for communities? This chapter addresses both questions, using examples ranging from giraffes nibbling on ant-laden acacias, to rapidly shifting coral-algal symbioses, to models of stage-structure interactions among mutualists. For an interaction between a pair of species to be mutualistic, benefits must exce

Research in eco-evolutionary dynamics and community genetics has demonstrated that variation within a species can have strong impacts on associated communities and ecosystem processes.

## Summary

As climatic changes and human uses intensify, resource managers and other decision makers are taking actions to either avoid or respond to ecosystem tipping points, or dramatic shifts in structure and function that are often costly and hard to reverse. Evidence indicates that explicitly addressing tipping points leads to improved management outcomes. Drawing on theory and examples from marine systems, we distill a set of seven principles to guide effective management in ecosystems with tipping p

## Summary

Twenty-first century conservation is centered on negotiating trade-offs between the diverse needs of people and the needs of the other species constituting coupled human-natural ecosystems. Marine forage fishes, such as sardines, anchovies and herring, are a nexus for such trade-offs because they are both central nodes in marine food webs and targeted by fisheries. An important example is Pacific herring, Clupea pallisii in the Northeast Pacific.

## Summary

Coral reefs harbor a hidden world of small organisms—crabs, shrimp, and other invertebrates—living within the complex three-dimensional structure of corals. This "cryptofauna" plays important roles in coral health, including defending corals from predators and removing harmful sediment.

This study demonstrates that larger reef predators, by consuming members of this cryptic community, can indirectly affect coral health. Predators disproportionately reduce the abundance of mutualist species that provide protective services to corals, potentially leaving corals more vulnerable to threats.

## Why This Matters

As fishing removes predators from reefs or protection allows them to recover, understanding these indirect effects is crucial for predicting how coral communities will respond. This research highlights the complex web of interactions that maintain healthy reefs.

    content: `Our lab has published new research in *Coral Reefs*.

## Summary

The "functional response"—how predator feeding rates change with prey density—is a fundamental concept in ecology. But on coral reefs, where multiple predators often hunt together, how does predator density affect this relationship?

This study used field experiments to show that predator density has complex effects on functional responses. At higher predator densities, interference between hunters can reduce per-capita feeding rates, but the combined impact on prey populations still intensifies. These dynamics help explain patterns of prey survival across reef landscapes with varying predator abundance.

## Why This Matters

Understanding how predators collectively impact prey populations is essential for predicting reef community responses to fishing and protection. This research provides mechanistic insight into predator-prey dynamics that drive coral reef ecosystem structure.

## Summary

Trophic island biogeography theory predicts that the effects of predators on prey diversity are context dependent in heterogeneous landscapes. Specifically, models predict that the positive effect of habitat area on prey diversity should decline in the presence of predators, and that predators should modify the partitioning of alpha and beta diversity across patchy landscapes. However, experimental tests of the predicted context dependency in top‐down control remain limited.

One of the most compelling questions in evolutionary biology is why some animals can regenerate injured structures while others cannot. Appendage regeneration appears to be common when viewed across the metazoan phylogeny, yet this ability has been lost in many taxa to varying degrees. Within species, the capacity for regeneration also can vary ontogenetically among individuals.

## Summary

The combined effects of multiple predators often cannot be predicted from their independent effects. Emergent multiple predator effects ( MPE s) include risk enhancement, where combined predators kill more prey than predicted by their individual effects, and risk reduction, where fewer prey are killed than predicted. Current methods for detecting MPE s are biased because they assume linear functional responses and/or no prey depletion.

## Summary

How do coral colonies influence their neighbors, and how does predation modify these interactions? This study used field experiments to manipulate both coral density and predator access to understand the factors controlling coral growth.

The results revealed that corals growing at higher densities experienced reduced growth rates, likely due to competition for resources like light and planktonic food. However, predation pressure also played a significant role—when predators were excluded, density effects became more pronounced. These findings highlight the complex interplay between competition and predation in shaping coral populations.

## Why This Matters

Understanding what limits coral growth is essential for reef restoration efforts. This research suggests that both spacing of coral transplants and predator management may influence restoration success.

## Summary

Coral reefs are one of the most diverse systems on the planet; yet, only a small fraction of coral reef species have attracted scientific study. Here, we document strong deleterious effects of an often overlooked species—the vermetid gastropod, Dendropoma maximum— on growth and survival of reef-building corals. Our surveys of vermetids on Moorea (French Polynesia) revealed a negative correlation between the density of vermetids and the per cent cover of live coral.

## Summary

Trophic cascades—where predators indirectly affect primary producers by controlling herbivore populations—are well-documented in many ecosystems. This study reveals an unexpected trophic cascade on coral reefs involving the "charismatic microfauna"—the small, often colorful crabs, shrimp, and other invertebrates living within corals.

By excluding these small consumers from coral colonies, researchers found significant changes in cyanobacterial communities growing on corals. The microfauna's grazing activity cascades down to affect microbial production, demonstrating that even tiny reef inhabitants play outsized ecological roles.

## Why This Matters

This research highlights the importance of small, often overlooked species in reef ecosystems. As reefs change due to climate stress and fishing, understanding these hidden connections becomes crucial for predicting ecosystem responses.

## Summary

Coral and rocky reef fish populations are widely used as model systems for the experimental exploration of density‐dependent vital rates, but patterns of density‐dependent mortality in these systems are not yet fully understood. In particular, the paradigm for strong, directly density‐dependent (DDD) postsettlement mortality stands in contrast to recent evidence for inversely density‐dependent (IDD) mortality. We review the processes responsible for DDD and IDD per capita mortality in reef fishe

## Summary

Increased habitat availability or quality can alter production of habitat‐dependent organisms in two contrasting ways: (1) by enhancing input of new colonists to the new sites (the Field‐of‐Dreams Hypothesis); and (2) by drawing colonists away from existing sites (the Propagule Redirection Hypothesis), and thus reducing the deleterious effects of density. We conducted a field experiment on coral reef fishes in Moorea, French Polynesia, to quantify how differing levels of habitat availability (co

## Summary

The crown-of-thorns seastar (Acanthaster planci) is infamous for devastating coral reefs during population outbreaks. But this study reveals a surprising twist: reef fish actually use these destructive predators as shelter.

Surveys in French Polynesia documented multiple fish species regularly associating with crown-of-thorns seastars. The spiny predators apparently provide protection from larger predators, creating an unexpected example of commensalism. This association highlights the complexity of reef ecosystems, where even harmful species can play nuanced ecological roles.

## Why This Matters

Crown-of-thorns control programs often aim to remove these seastars to protect corals. Understanding their role as fish habitat adds complexity to management decisions and reveals how interconnected reef ecosystems truly are.

## Summary

Many communities experience repeated periods of colonization due to seasonally regenerating habitats or pulsed arrival of young‐of‐year. When an individual's persistence in a community depends upon the strength of competitive interactions, changes in the timing of arrival relative to the arrival of a competitor can modify competitive strength and, ultimately, establishment in the community. We investigated whether the strength of intracohort competitive interactions between recent settlers of th
