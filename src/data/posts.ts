    content: `Coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, acidification, and disease have killed half the world's reef-building corals in the last 30 years. 

**The core finding:** The fishes can also benefit the corals, through fish-derived services resulting from, for example, diurnal and nocturnal movements, foraging, and nutrient excretion.

**The bigger picture:** Coral reefs are built by tiny animals, but they don't do it alone. A web of relationships with fish, crabs, and other creatures helps corals survive stresses that would otherwise kill them. Scientists are still working to understand which of these partnerships matter most for reef survival.

    content: `Coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, acidification, and disease have killed half the world's reef-building corals in the last 30 years. New research reveals that when the strength of predation shifts (e.g., due to exploitative harvest of top predators, introduction of new species, or range shifts in response to climate change), mutualist communities will exhibit dynamic responses with nonmonotonic effects on host service provision.

**The core finding:** Here, we use a mathemati- cal model of a predatory fish that consumes two competing coral mutualists to show that predators can also have indirect positive effects on hosts when they preferentially consume competitively dominant mutualists that are also lower in quality. Our findings suggest that when the strength of predation shifts (e.g., due to exploit- ative harvest of top predators, introduction of new species, or range shifts in response to climate change), mutualist communities will exhibit dynamic responses with nonmonotonic effects on host service provision.

    content: `New research reveals that temperature plays a key role in driving the geographic range of spiny lobsters and that spatial and temporal shifts in temperature can play a critical role in driving the strength of species interactions for a key predator in temperate reef ecosystems.

**The core finding:** We acclimated individual lobsters to temperatures they experience sacross their biogeographic range (11, 16, 21, or 26°C), then measured whether lobster consumption rates are able to meet the increased metabolic demands of rising temperatures.Results and discussionWe show positive effects of temperature on metabolism and predation, but in contrast to our hypothesis, rising temperature caused lobster consumption rates to increase at a faster rate than increases in metabolic demand, suggesting that for the mid-range of temperatures, lobsters are capable of ramping up consumption rates to increase their caloric demand. Our results suggest that temperature plays a key role in driving the geographic range of spiny lobsters and that spatial and temporal shifts in temperature can play a critical role in driving the strength of species interactions for a key predator in temperate reef ecosystems.

**What the numbers show:** At the coldest temperature, lobsters had almost no metabolic activity and at the highest temperature, 33% of lobsters died.

**How they studied it:** This research used bayesian models.

**The core finding:** Yet across taxa, interaction strength is strongly related to predator size, prey size and prey density, suggesting that general cross‐taxonomic relationships could be used to predict how strongly individual species interact. Based on these results, we then estimated variation in lobster–urchin interaction strength across five sites and 9 years of observational data.

    content: `Kelp forests—the rainforests of the sea—are disappearing along coastlines worldwide. New research reveals that kelp degradation over 96 h was minimal relative to the accu- racy of estimating the weight of kelp (~"2% error).

**The core finding:** To test this hypothesis, we quantified how the foraging habits of an important group of marine herbivores—sea urchins—change with increases in sea urchin biomass and trigger regime shifts to a foundation species, giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera).

**Key result:** We found no evidence for a nonlinear rela- tionship between urchin biomass and consumptive capacity.

**The bigger picture:** Kelp forests grow in cold, nutrient-rich waters along temperate coastlines worldwide. These underwater forests provide habitat for hundreds of species and buffer coastlines from storms, but they're vulnerable to warming waters and overgrazing by sea urchins.

**The core finding:** We then used catastrophe theory to show that fishing and warming have caused a previously undetected and potentially irreversible regime shift. Our study emphasizes the combined effects of local and global human impacts in driving significant ecosystem shifts and suggests that adaptation is likely the central avenue forward for maintaining services in the face of global climate change.

**Key result:** We showed for thefirst time that the North Sea underwent a true, irreversible regime shift and that the community completely restructured after 2003.

    content: `Coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, acidification, and disease have killed half the world's reef-building corals in the last 30 years. New research reveals that surprisingly, we found no relationship between human influence and resistance to disturbance and some evidence that areas with greater human development may recover from disturbance faster than their more isolated counterparts.

Even when monitoring is imprecise, very con- servative harvest rates still lead to very high relative resource biomass through time. However, the relative benefits of heavy monitoring decline somewhat as populations spend increasingly high amounts of time overhar- vested at very high harvest rates > 1.0H MSY . Populations that are poorly monitored and heavily harvested tend to regularly dip into the danger zone .

**Key result:** We show that precautionary buffers that trigger increased monitoring precision as resource levels decline may offer a way to minimize monitoring costs and maximize profits.

**The core finding:** Statistics, Where species underwent multiple status changes, we calculated status change metrics using only genuine changes, making our results qualitatively similar to calculation of the Red List Index (RLI) for taxa that have undergone comprehensive assessment. We note that these recovery metrics are conservative indicators; change in extinc- tion risk status, in particular, represents a high bar for recovery as ‘no change’ may indicate an absence of data or outdated assessment.

**What the numbers show:** Here, we synthesize cases of recovery from a list of 362 species of large carnivores, ecologically important species that function as terminal consumers in many ecological contexts.

**The core finding:** In contrast and surprisingly, however, coastal marine biodiversity (measured as the density and evenness of epibenthic invertebrate families) tended to be higher at more urbanized sites, suggesting the potential role of low to moderate levels of urbanization-related disturbance in determining coastal marine biodiversity patterns. We found no statistical association between urbanization and freshwater and coastal marine ecosystem functions, estimated from changes in accumulated algal biomass on tiles (benthic net primary productivity) and loss of biomass from litter bags (decomposition).

Overall, this study provides a foundation for future work on how coral-associated fauna influence the bioenergetics of their host corals, which in turn has implications for how these corals respond to bleaching-inducing stressors.

    content: `Coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, acidification, and disease have killed half the world's reef-building corals in the last 30 years. New research reveals that furthermore, we show that their direct impacts on survivorship and size distributions of one native prey species are similar to those of a native mesopredator.

**The core finding:** Here, we present empirical evidence from Caribbean Panama and beyond suggesting that lionfish are less abundant than native mesopredators. Furthermore, we show that their direct impacts on survivorship and size distributions of one native prey species are similar to those of a native mesopredator.

**Key result:** Our results demonstrate that lionfish are less common than native mesopredators in Caribbean Panama and beyond, but it is possible that lionfish impacts on native prey are greater (Albins2013; Ellis and Faletti2016).

**The bigger picture:** Coral reefs are built by tiny animals, but they don't do it alone. A web of relationships with fish, crabs, and other creatures helps corals survive stresses that would otherwise kill them. Scientists are still working to understand which of these partnerships matter most for reef survival.

    content: `Coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, acidification, and disease have killed half the world's reef-building corals in the last 30 years. 

**The core finding:** Our analyses show significant differences in intraspecific feeding rates, time spent grazing, and intensity of grazing across sites, which may alter the ecological impact of a given scarid population. We suggest several hypothesized mechanisms for these behavioral variations that would benefit from explicit testing in future research.

**Key result:** Our findings demonstrate the variability of grazing behavior across different reef sites and call for further investigation of the drivers and ecological implications of these inconsistencies.

**The bigger picture:** Coral reefs support a quarter of all marine species while covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. Understanding the ecological processes that maintain these ecosystems is crucial as they face unprecedented threats.

New research reveals that we showed that the stability of understory algae and sessile invertebrates was positively and indirectly related to the stability of giant kelp, which primarily resulted from giant kelp's direct positive association with species richness.

**The core finding:** Despite their critical importance, the role of foundation species in stabilizing natural communities has seldom been quantified. In theory, the stability of a foundation species should promote community stability by enhancing species richness, altering the population fluctuations of individual species, or both.

**Key result:** We showed that the stability of under- story algae and sessile invertebrates was positively and indirectly related to the stability of giant kelp, which primarily resulted from giant kelp’s direct positive association with species rich- ness.

**The bigger picture:** Kelp forests grow in cold, nutrient-rich waters along temperate coastlines worldwide. These underwater forests provide habitat for hundreds of species and buffer coastlines from storms, but they're vulnerable to warming waters and overgrazing by sea urchins.

After a brief historical overview of ILTER, with emphasis on the marine component, we analyze the potential contribution of the ILTER-CMS to global coastal and ocean observation, adopting the "Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT)" approach. We also identify ways in which the in situ parameters collected at ILTER sites currently fit within the Essential Ocean Variables framework (as proposed by the Framework for Ocean Observation recommendations) and provide insights on the use of new technology in long-term studies. Final recommendations point at the need to further develop observational activities at LTER sites and improve coordination among them and with external related initiatives in order to maximise their exploitation and address present and future challenges in ocean observations.

**What the numbers show:** While most (50%) of the ILTER-CMS were established after the year 2000, in some cases they date back to the early 1900s.

**The core finding:** Expert perceptions of the herring food web varied markedly in structure, and a simulated herring recovery with each of these unique mental models demonstrated wide variability in the perceived impor- tance of herring to the surrounding food web.

**Key result:** We show here that among-expert differences in perceptions of ecosystem structure are log- ically tied to consequences for how an individual might view the outcomes or impacts of predicted future change.

    content: `New research reveals that we found two significant threshold relationships in the full GAM analyses with plausible mechanistic under- pinnings.

**The core finding:** To demonstrate how to apply the framework, we explored two decades of data using gradient forest and generalized additive model analyses, screening for nonlinearities and potential threshold responses of ecosystem states (n = 9) across environmental (n = 6) and human (n = 10) pressures. This result is consistent with the idea that the influence of the PDO extends across multiple trophic levels, but extends current knowledge by defining the nonlinear nature of these responses.

**Key result:** Our analysis reveals effects of both environmen- tal and human pressures as major predictors of individual and aggregated ecosystem states in the CCS.

**The core finding:** Here, we combine field surveys and a laboratory feeding experiment in coral reef fish communities to show that small and large predators of the same species can have similar effects. Specifically, surveys show that the presence of a small predator ( Paracirrhites arcatus ) was correlated with lower chances of prey fish presence, but these correlations were independent of predator size.

**Key result:** Our results indicate that the effects of small predators on coral reefs can be size-independent, suggesting that variation in predator size- structure alone may not always affect the functional role of these predators.

    content: `New research reveals that we show the effects of predators on abundance, richness, Jaccard index of beta diversity, and the proposed rarefied Jaccard index.

**The core finding:** Many ecological processes such as immigration, predation, or nutrient limitation affect abundance and asymptotic beta diversity concurrently; thus, existing metrics may confound changes in asymptotic beta diversity with changes that result from differences in abundance or sampling. Results from a stochastic simulation model illustrate how decreasing within-patch sample size may either increase or decrease observed beta diversity, depending on the type of metric, sample size, and community properties; these changes are easy to understand, and predict, by considering the effects of sampling on variance.

**Key result:** We show the effects of predators on abundance, richness, Jaccard index of beta diversity, and the proposed rarefied Jaccard index.

Moreover, mutualisms modulate other mechanisms that influence diversity, at times enhancing dominance of some species over others (thus reducing diversity), and at times by providing additional avenues for niche differentiation, enhancing diversity. Mutualisms can alter species range limits and thus define the species pool available for local community assembly, and even alter community stability. The chapter ends with key open questions.

**The core finding:** Research in eco-evolutionary dynamics and community genetics has demonstrated that variation within a species can have strong impacts on associated communities and ecosystem processes. Using two species that co-occur and demonstrate adaptation to their natal environments, black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) and three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), we investigated the effects of intraspecific phenotypic variation on both top-down and bottom-up forces using a large-scale aquatic mesocosm experiment.

**Key result:** We found pervasive genotype by ecotype interactions at the community level, as four of the eight most common taxa showed significant interactions (Bosmina, notonectids, mayflies and oligochaetes; electronic supplementary material, ).

    content: `Coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, acidification, and disease have killed half the world's reef-building corals in the last 30 years. New research reveals that we found independent effects of groupers and patch characteristics on prey communities.

**The core finding:** We found independent effects of groupers and patch characteristics on prey communities. Null model analysis demonstrated that groupers increased the importance of stochastic community assembly relative to patches without groupers.

**What the numbers show:** Groupers reduced prey abundance by 50% and gamma diversity by 45%, with a disproportionate removal of rare species relative to common species (64% and 36% reduction, respectively; an oddity effect).

**The bigger picture:** Coral reefs are built by tiny animals, but they don't do it alone. A web of relationships with fish, crabs, and other creatures helps corals survive stresses that would otherwise kill them. Scientists are still working to understand which of these partnerships matter most for reef survival.

New research reveals that the timing of predator arrival can be as important as predator density in modifying prey abundance and community composition.

**The core finding:** We controlled for intrinsic variation in survivorship among species and found that competition among these 3 species was highly asymmetric, resulting in a simple competitive hierarchy (sequence of competitive ability from superior to inferior competitors): fivestripe wrasse > bird wrasse > sixbar wrasse. Our work demonstrates that intense asymmetric competition and the formation of competitive hierarchies may be an important determinant of resource monopolization and patterns of distribution and abundance in reef fishes.

**What the numbers show:** We found hawkfish on 66 of the 192 surveyed patch reefs; we focus our analysis on 55 of the 66 reefs where hawkfish were observed at least twice.

New research reveals that the multiplicative (log-link) model fitted the data worse than an analogous model using the standard logit link, because the logit-link model was better able to handle block–treatment combinations with high expected predation rates.

**The core finding:** In contrast, the combined defensive efficacy of both mutualist species reduced the volume of coral tissue lost by 73%, signifi- cantly more than the 38% reduction expected from independent defensive efforts, suggesting the existence of a cooperative synergy in defensive behaviors of ‘guard’ crustaceans.

New research reveals that nudibranchs can substantially reduce sea hare abundance, which in turn promotes the growth of cyanobacteria via a reduction in grazing pressure

Predation of sea hares reduced herbivory. Cyanobacterial biomass was 1.5 times greater when nudibranchs were present relative to when nudibranchs were absent. Although sea hare grazing can substantially reduce cyanobacterial biomass, predation of sea hares may mitigate grazing pressure, and therefore increase the abundance of cyanobacteria.

**What the numbers show:** Nudi- branchs consumed on average 2.4 sea hares d -1 , with the consumption of small sea hares 22 times greater than the consumption of large sea hares.

New research reveals that predation can alter diversity of reef fish communities by indiscriminately reducing the abundance of fishes soon after settlement, thereby reducing the number of species present on reefs.

**The core finding:** Effects of predators varied somewhat among families, however, rarefaction analysis indicated that predators foraged non-selectively among species. These results indicate that predation can alter diversity of reef fish communities by indiscriminately reducing the abundance of fishes soon after settlement, thereby reducing the number of species present on reefs.

**What the numbers show:** At the end of the 54-day experi- ment, recruits were 74% less abundant on reefs exposed to predators than on caged ones, and species richness was 42% lower on reefs exposed to predators.

    content: `Coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, acidification, and disease have killed half the world's reef-building corals in the last 30 years. 

Stony corals provide important structural hab- itat for microbes, invertebrates, and fishes, which in some cases has led to the evolution of beneficial interactions that may protect corals from environmental factors such as thermal stress, nutrient limitation, competitors, or preda- tors. For example, guard crabs (Trapeziaspp.) protect corals (Pocilloporasp.) from attacks by crown-of-thorn seastar and sedimentation. Here, a field experiment dem- onstrates that guard crabs (Trapezia serenei) also amelio- rate the strong negative effects of the giant vermetid (Dendropoma maximum) on growth ofPocillopora.This experiment highlights the importance of this crab-coral mutualism: guard crabs facilitate the growth of corals in stressful environments (e.g., where vermetids are abun- dant), thereby preserving the ecological goods and services (e.g., food and shelter) that these corals may provide to other reef-associated species.

**The bigger picture:** Coral reefs are built by tiny animals, but they don't do it alone. A web of relationships with fish, crabs, and other creatures helps corals survive stresses that would otherwise kill them. Scientists are still working to understand which of these partnerships matter most for reef survival.

**The core finding:** As a result, DDD mortality may be more common than IDD mortality on patch reefs, which tend to constrain predator foraging to the same scale as prey aggregation, eliminating attack‐abatement effects. The results of nearly all prior reef fish studies fit within this framework, although additional work is needed to test many of the predicted outcomes.

**The bigger picture:** Coral reefs are built by tiny animals, but they don't do it alone. A web of relationships with fish, crabs, and other creatures helps corals survive stresses that would otherwise kill them. Scientists are still working to understand which of these partnerships matter most for reef survival.

    content: `Coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, acidification, and disease have killed half the world's reef-building corals in the last 30 years. New research reveals that results suggest the repeated use of clove oil (even without a solvent) can deleteriously affect corals.

**What the numbers show:** Our results suggest that repeated applications of concentrations of clove oil≥14% can, on average, reduce growth by 30- 40%, and increase bleaching by 20-80%, relative to controls.

**The bigger picture:** Coral reefs are built by tiny animals, but they don't do it alone. A web of relationships with fish, crabs, and other creatures helps corals survive stresses that would otherwise kill them. Scientists are still working to understand which of these partnerships matter most for reef survival.
